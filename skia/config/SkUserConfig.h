#define SKIA_CONFIG_SKUSERCONFIG_H_

/*  SkTypes.h, the root of the public header files, does the following trick:

    #include "include/config/SkUserConfig.h"
    #include "include/core/SkPostConfig.h"
    #include "include/core/SkPreConfig.h"

    SkPreConfig.h runs first, and it is responsible for initializing certain
    skia defines.

    SkPostConfig.h runs last, and its job is to just check that the final
    defines are consistent (i.e. that we don't have mutually conflicting
    defines).

    SkUserConfig.h (this file) runs in the middle. It gets to change or augment
    the list of flags initially set in preconfig, and then postconfig checks
    that everything still makes sense.

    Below are optional defines that add, subtract, or change default behavior
    in Skia. Your port can locally edit this file to enable/disable flags as
    you choose, or these can be delared on your command line (i.e. -Dfoo).

    By default, this include file will always default to having all of the flags
    commented out, so including it will have no effect.

/*  Skia has lots of debug-only code. Often this is just null checks or other
    parameter checking, but sometimes it can be quite intrusive (e.g. check that
    each 32bit pixel is in premultiplied form). This code can be very useful
    during development, but will slow things down in a shipping product.

    By default, these mutually exclusive flags are defined in SkPreConfig.h,
    based on the presence or absence of NDEBUG, but that decision can be changed
    here.

    enabled by uncommenting them below.
