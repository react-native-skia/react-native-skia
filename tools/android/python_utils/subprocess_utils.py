    """Runs a command and returns the output as a string.

  For example, run_command(['echo', ' Hello, world!\n']) returns the string
  'Hello, world!' and run_command(['pwd'], cwd='/usr/local/bin') returns the
  string '/usr/local/bin'.

  Args:
    command:
      A sequence of strings representing the command to run, starting with the
      executable name followed by the arguments.
    cwd:
      The working directory in which to run the command; if not specified,
      defaults to the current working directory.
    cmd_input:
      Input text that should be automatically passed to the process's stdin.
    exitcode_only:
      Avoid re-raising any errors or logging any output for errors. Useful for
      commands that are expected to return a non-zero exit status.

  Returns:
    If |exitcode_only| is True, then only the exitcode is returned.
    Otherwise, output (stdout) of the command as a string. Leading and trailing
    whitespace are stripped from the output.

  Raises
    CalledProcessError:
      The command returned a non-zero exit code indicating failure; the error
      code is printed along with the error message (stderr) and output (stdout),
      if any.
    FileNotFoundError: The executable specified in the command was not found.
