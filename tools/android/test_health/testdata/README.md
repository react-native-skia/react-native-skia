# Sample Files for Tests

## Overview

This directory contains sample files to facilitate unit-testing the Python
modules in the parent directory (`//tools/android/test_health`).

## Java Tests

None of the tests in this directory are legitimate tests and they do not need
to be run. The Java files and `javatests` directory tree are used solely as
input to Python unit tests.
