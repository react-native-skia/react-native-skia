Description:
This package is used by the command-line utilities in tools/origin_trials to
sign tokens for experimental feature usage, and to verify the signatures on
those tokens.
Although this package does provide cryptographic signing and verification
capabilities, it is currently not considered security-critical. It is only used
to sign tokens for use in unit tests, or for custom developer builds of Chrome;
not to generate tokens usable in release Chrome builds, and not for verification
of signatures. This classification may change if the package is used for other
purposes in the future.

Local Modifications:
Minimal python3 compatibility modifications were made. Specifically, division
operators were modified to use python 2 and 3-compatible integer division rather
than python3's default of floating point division.
