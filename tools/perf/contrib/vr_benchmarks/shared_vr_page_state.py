  This is a hacky way to automatically change the shared page state that's used
  depending on which platform the benchmark is being run on. The
  shared_page_state_class that gets passed to the Page constructor must be an
  instance of SharedState, so we can't just pass a function pointer that returns
  an instance of the correct subclass when called.

  Additionally, we only really know what platform we're being run on after
  SharedPageState's constructor is called, as we can't rely on the given
  possible_browser to determine it.

  So, we have to call SharedPageState's constructor, find out which platform
  we're being run on, switch our class out for the correct one, and
  re-construct ourselves.
