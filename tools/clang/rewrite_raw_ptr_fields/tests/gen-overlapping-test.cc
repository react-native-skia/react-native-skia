// This file (and other gen-*-test.cc files) tests generation of output for
// --field-filter-file and therefore the expectations file
// (gen-overlapping-expected.txt) needs to be compared against the raw output of
// the rewriter (rather than against the actual edits result).  This makes the
// test incompatible with other tests, which require passing --apply-edits
// switch to test_tool.py and so to disable the test it is named *-test.cc
// rather than *-original.cc.
//
// To run the test use tools/clang/rewrite_raw_ptr_fields/tests/run_all_tests.py
