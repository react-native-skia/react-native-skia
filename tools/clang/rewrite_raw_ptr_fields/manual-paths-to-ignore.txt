# File that lists regular expressions of paths that should be ignored when
# running the rewrite_raw_ptr_fields tool on Chromium sources.
#
# If a source file path contains any of the lines in the filter file below,
# then such source file will not be rewritten.
#
# Lines prefixed with "!" can be used to force include files that matched a file
# path to be ignored.
#
# Note that the rewriter has a hardcoded logic for a handful of path-based
# exclusions that cannot be expressed as substring matches:
# - Excluding paths containing "third_party/", but still covering
#   "third_party/blink/"
#   (see the isInThirdPartyLocation AST matcher in RewriteRawPtrFields.cpp).
# - Excluding paths _starting_ with "gen/" or containing "/gen/"
#   (i.e. hopefully just the paths under out/.../gen/... directory)
#   via the isInGeneratedLocation AST matcher in RewriteRawPtrFields.cpp.

# Exclude code that only runs inside a renderer process - renderer
# processes are excluded for now from the MiraclePtr project scope,
# because they are sensitive to performance regressions (to a much higher
# degree than, say, the Browser process).
#
# Note that some renderer-only directories are already excluded
# elsewhere - for example "v8/" is excluded in another part of this
# file.
#
# The common/ directories must be included in the rewrite as they contain code
# that is also used from the browser process.
#
# Also, note that isInThirdPartyLocation AST matcher in
# RewriteRawPtrFields.cpp explicitly includes third_party/blink
# (because it is in the same git repository as the rest of Chromium),
# but we go ahead and exclude most of it below (as Renderer-only code).

# Exclude paths in separate repositories - i.e. in directories that
