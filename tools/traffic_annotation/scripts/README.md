# Traffic Annotation Scripts
This file describes the scripts in `tools/traffic_annotation/scripts`.

# auditor/auditor.py

The new implementation of `traffic_annotation_auditor`. It is meant as a
drop-in replacement, i.e. you can call it with the same command-line arguments
and it should give similar output.

# check_annotations.py
Runs traffic annotation tests on the changed files or all repository. The tests
are run in error resilient mode. Requires a compiled build directory to run.

# traffic_annotation_auditor_tests.py
Runs tests to ensure traffic_annotation_auditor is performing as expected. Tests
include:
 - Checking if auditor and underlying extractor run, and an expected minimum
   number of outputs are returned.
 - Checking if enabling or disabling heuristics that make tests faster has any
   effect on the output.
 - Checking if running on the whole repository (instead of only changed files)
   would result in any error.
This test may take a few hours to run and requires a compiled build directory.

# annotation_tools.py
Provides tools for annotation test scripts.

# update_annotations_sheet.py
This script updates the Google sheet that presents all network traffic
annotations.

# extractor.py
Scans through a set of specified C++ files to detect existing traffic
annotations in code. It uses regex expressions on source files.

# extractor_test.py
Unit tests for extractor.py.

# update_annotations_doc.py
Updates the Chrome Browser Network Traffic Annotations document that presents
all network traffic annotations specified within `summary/grouping.xml`.
  - You can use the `hidden="true"` attribute within a group to suppress the
    group and its nested senders and annotations from appearing in the document.
  - You can use the `hidden="true"` attribute within the annotations in
    `grouping.xml` to suppress them from appearing in the document.
  - `grouping.xml` needn't be organized in alphabetical order, the script
    automatically places them in alphabetical order.

# update_annotations_doc_tests.py
Unit tests for update_annotations_doc.py.

# generator_utils.py
Parses the `grouping.xml` and `annotations.tsv` files to provide
`update_annotations_doc.py` with the annotations and their relevant information,
e.g. unique_id, data, trigger, etc. Also includes methods to parse the json
object returned by the Google Docs API `get()` method.

# generator_utils_tests.py
Unit tests for generator_utils.py.
