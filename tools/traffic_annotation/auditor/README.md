# Network Traffic Annotation Auditor

THIS CODEBASE IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed soon(ish). The new
implementation can be found at `tools/traffic_annotation/scripts/auditor/auditor.py`. It
is a drop-in replacement for traffic_annotation_auditor, so you can run it with
the same command-line arguments, etc.

<!-- TODO(crbug.com/1119417): Remove t_a_auditor-related code after enough
     time running auditor.py by default (to ensure it's relatively bug-free).
  -->

See
[tools/traffic_annotation/scripts/auditor/README.md](/tools/traffic_annotation/scripts/auditor/README.md)
for more details.
