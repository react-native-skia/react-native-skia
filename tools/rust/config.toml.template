# Vendor crates.io dependencies to rust-src/vendor and check they match root
# Cargo.lock. In the future we will probably want to vendor these ourself like
# we do with third_party/rust dependencies. For now, the Rust build script auto
# fetches the dependencies.
#
# This is added now to work around a permissions bug in Rust's bootstrap:
# it fails to run under sudo even if the sudo user is not root, unless sources
# are vendored in tree.
