This file is a comprehensive list of Chrome user actions along with the owner
and description for each user action.

For best practices on writing user action descriptions, see
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/actions/README.md
For details on how to modify this file to add your description, keep reading.

If an action is not user triggered, specify it using not_user_triggered="true"
as an attribute to the <action> tag.

Please run extract_actions.py to add new actions and pretty-print this file.

If a user action is not being used any more, put an <obsolete> tag under
the <action> tag with necessary explanation. Don't delete things in this file.

Please send CLs to chromium-metrics-reviews@google.com rather than to specific
individuals. These CLs will be automatically reassigned to a reviewer within
about 5 minutes. This approach helps the metrics team to load-balance incoming
reviews. Googlers can read more about this at go/gwsq-gerrit.

TODO(yiyaoliu):
Currently, only file-level comments are supported. By running
extract_actions.py, comments at other places will be deleted. Ideally, comments
should be able to be added at any place in this file.

  <description>
    Emitted when the Ash window manager hotkey handler handles the
    &quot;Ctrl-Shift-T&quot; shortcut that causes the most recently closed tab
    to be restored. Because it's related to Ash, it's ChromeOS only. This is
    only emitted when the Ash hotkey handler handles the shortcut, which only
    happens when a non-Chrome window is focussed on ChromeOS. (The launcher is
    an example of a non-Chrome window.) If a Chrome window was focussed on
    ChromeOS as the user presses the keyboard shortcut, it's handled by Chrome's
    keyboard shortcut handler system. In that case, the user action RestoreTab
    is emitted, not Accel_Restore_Tab.

    It's never the case that both Accel_Restore_Tab and RestoreTab are emitted
    for the same keyboard shortcut press.

    Note: if the last user action was to close an entire window with multiple
    tabs, this keyboard shortcut will cause the entire window to be restored,
    containing multiple tabs. This user action is only emitted once however,
    regardless of the number of tabs.

    This is not emitted during session restore that occurs as part of startup.

    This user action is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

<action name="MobileComeToForeground">
  <owner>tedchoc@chromium.org</owner>
  <description>
    Chrome has come to the foreground. Only emitted if the foreground content is
    an Activity that views web content, e.g., not settings. This will be emitted
    everytime the Activity goes from entirely hidden to at least partially
    visible. Partially visible means that at least some portion of the Activity
    is visible, but the Activity is not interactable, e.g. being covered by the
    share dialog, javascript alert dialogs, the voice input dialog, etc.

    Please note, this has the potential to be called many times for a given
    session. For further details, see the Android activity concept of onPause
    and onResume for a better understanding of what circumstances can trigger
    this.

    Session tracking is based on the same visibility concept, but a session can
    span multiple live Android Activities, while this metric will be logged when
    each applicable Activity goes to the foreground (per above). Since session
    tracking uses onPause and onResume, this metric is also tied to that to
    ensure we capture the event.

<action name="NavEntryCommitted" not_user_triggered="true">
  <owner>mpearson@chromium.org</owner>
  <description>
    Emitted when a navigation commits. Recorded on both main-frame and sub-frame
    navigations.

    Example of &quot;one or more times&quot;: navigating to
    http://www.google.com will cause two emits.

    A set of NavEntryCommitted emitted in quick succession can be approximately
    viewed as a &quot;page load&quot;, though possibly in a sub-frame on a page.
    A NavEntryCommitted can happen for a variety of reasons: link clicks,
    omnibox navigations, reload button, back/forward, Javascript that changes
    the URL of the page, etc. Examples of Javascript changing the URL without
    changing the page that cause this to be emitted is switching slides in
    Google Slides or switching between the inbox and a message in gmail. These
    cases happen by changing the URL hash (#whatever) or
    history.pushState()/history.replaceState().

    Note: this is even emitted on a &quot;navigation&quot; to non-web pages,
    such as loading the NTP.

    Each set of NavEntryCommitted emitted in quick succession usually are
    triggered by a single user action. In this sense, all but the first in the
    set are &quot;not user triggered&quot;.

    Desktop-only.
  </description>
</action>

<action name="NavEntryCommitted.SRP" not_user_triggered="true">
  <owner>mpearson@chromium.org</owner>
  <description>
    Emitted when a navigation happens to a page whose URL looks like it's a URL
    from the user's default search engine. I.e., emitted when it looks like--via
    a simple pattern match--the user navigated to a search results page.

    Prior to M-108, this was possible to be emitted for all navigations, even
    within profiles such as &quot;system&quot; profiles that don't allow the
    user to search. (We expect it was rarely if even logged in those settings.)
    In those settings, it looked for the search engine used by default in this
    install of Chrome. This is typically Google. In M-108 and later, this user
    action is eligible to be emitted only for profiles that allow the user to
    search: regular profiles, Incognito profiles, and Guest profiles.

    NavEntryCommitted will also always be emitted at the same time (in the same
    code, just a few lines before).

    As with NavEntryCommitted (read the description of that user action),
    NavEntryCommitted.SRP is emitted roughly when the URL in the omnibox
    changes. This can happen via Javascript by, for example, scrolling through a
    news article carousel on the user's search engine page. As such,
    NavEntryCommitted.SRP does not necessarily align with the number of searches
    done, though it's certainly related.

    Desktop-only.

  <owner>mpearson@chromium.org</owner>

  <description>
    Emitted every time a user uses a Home button to go to their home page and
    their the page is not chrome-internal (such as an actual web site instead of
    the New Tab Page or about:blank). For the purpose of this action, about:,
    chrome: and chrome-native: are considered chrome-internal; everything else
    is not.

    This is logged at the same time that the Navigation.Home.IsChromeInternal
    histogram is logged.

    This action is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

<action name="RestoreTab">
  <owner>mpearson@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrisha@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-analysis-team@google.com</owner>
  <description>
    Emitted anytime the most recently closed tab is restored via
    browser/ui/browser_tab_restorer.cc. This occurs either via the
    (Ctrl-Shift-T) hotkey or the tab context menu. These are cases where the
    user hasn't explicitly selected a recently closed tab; the user is asking
    that the most recently closed tab be restored. Thus, it's not recorded, for
    example, if the user uses three-dots menu &gt; History &gt; Recently Closed
    Tabs and selects a tab, as in this case the user has selected a recently
    closed tab explicitly. That case and cases like it go directly to
    TabRestoreService::RestoreEntryById and bypass the browser_tab_restorer code
    path.

    Note: if the last user action was to close an entire window with multiple
    tabs, this RestoreTab action will cause the entire window to be restored,
    containing multiple tabs. This user action is only emitted once however,
    regardless of the number of tabs.

    This is not emitted during session restore that occurs as part of startup.

    This user action is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.
