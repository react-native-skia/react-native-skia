  <summary>
    The size of the TouchEventAckQueue, recorded each time we process an event
    ack (the queue usually, but not always, decreases in size during ack
    processing). Ideally this queue will operate at length close to zero,
    depending on how long it takes for events to travel to a renderer and be
    processed and an ack sent back. As the size increases it indicates decreased
    responsiveness of renderers with respect to touch events. One purpose of
    this metric is to develop a sense of normal queue sizes for different
    platforms. Initially we expect queue length to be less than 20 most of the

    0% means all the lag existing before prediction was removed. 100% means that

    Time between initial creation of a wheel event and start of the frame swap

    scrolling sequence is excluded from this metric.

    Warning: This metric may include reports from clients with low-resolution
    clocks (i.e. on Windows, ref. |TimeTicks::IsHighResolution()|). Such reports
    will cause this metric to have an abnormal distribution. When considering
    revising this histogram, see UMA_HISTOGRAM_CUSTOM_MICROSECONDS_TIMES for the
    solution.

    When tracking input event latency, we expect to associate some number of
    latency records (instances of ui::LatencyInfo) with a CompositorFrame. Each
    record is associated to a particular navigation through its ukm::SourceId

    have varying or invalid source ids. See crbug.com/1062764.
