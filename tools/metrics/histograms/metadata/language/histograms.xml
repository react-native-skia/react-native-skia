    Whether or not the Chrome override language matches the Android system
    language. An exact match means that the full locale tag matches (e.g.
    en-GB). The same base language means that only the language part of the
    locale matches. Since Android requires a country in the locale but Chrome
    only has country variants for a few languages an exact match is rare.
