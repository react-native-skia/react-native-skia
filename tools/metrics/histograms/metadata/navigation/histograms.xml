    Note: We will only track actions that might affect the user after we've
    navigated away from the old page, such as modifications to storage,
    navigations, or sending/receiving postMessage.

    Note 2: We will not track actions taken when the unload event is currently

    Hash (base::HashMetricName) of a mojo interface name.

    Renderers should not be sending messages back to the browser for pages that
    are in the back-forward cache. Eventually we will be killing such renderers
    (as we could assume that it is misbehaving because it got compromised). But
    first we must make sure that we are not sending messages by mistake (i.e.
