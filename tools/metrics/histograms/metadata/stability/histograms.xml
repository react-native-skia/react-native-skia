  <summary>
    Individual enum counts specific conditions of child process terminations.
    There are too many individual states to enumerate into a single histogram,
    so this effectively does the aggregration that normally happens on the
    server side in the client instead. The benefit is this is easily extensible
    in the future, and downside is that it does not allow additional server side
    analysis. Note a single child process termination may fall into multiple

    Recorded when iOS app has started after a crash caused by system signal or

    Chrome update. See go/bling-stability-101 for information about signal
    crashes, hangs, UTEs and XTEs. This metric intends to complement
    Stability.Counts. Stability.Counts does include UTEs / XTEs and thus is a
    noisy metric which significantly overcounts user-visible crashes.
    Stability.IOS.Experimental.Counts2 is not recorded on OOM crashes, so it
    does not represent all user-visible crashes, but OOMs are so rare in Chrome
    for iOS that Stability.IOS.Experimental.Counts2 is still a good proxy for
    user-visible crashes. IOS.MetricKit.ForegroundExitData includes OOM crashes

    Type of the shutdown. This histogram is recorded at startup and logs a

    the OS, normally due to memory pressure. If memory pressure is extremely
    high, the app may not have had a chance to response to a memory warning
    before being killed. For first launch after upgrade, the crash reports may

    Stability.MobileSessionShutdownType should be in the stability log, which
