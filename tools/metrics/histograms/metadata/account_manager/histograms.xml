  <owner>sinhak@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>anastasiian@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the result of in-session account addition (or re-authentication)
    triggers on Chrome OS. This is recorded whenever an in-session account
    addition (or re-authentication) is triggered and user finishes or cancels
    the flow.
  </summary>

<histogram name="AccountManager.AccountAdditionSource"
    enum="AccountManagerAccountAdditionSource" expires_after="2023-04-09">

  <owner>anastasiian@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the source of in-session account addition (or re-authentication)
    triggers on Chrome OS. This is recorded whenever an in-session account
    addition (or re-authentication) is triggered - either explicitely by the
    user, or automatically by Gaia (for accounts requiring immediate
    re-authentication).

  <summary>
    The result of fetching an access token for the child with `accounts.reauth`
    scope in secondary EDU account addition flow. Recorded after parent enters
    their password. This metric covers both v1 and v2 of EduCoexistence.

  <summary>
    Records the last completed step in the EDU account addition flow. Allows to
    track the drop rate by important states during the in session flow.

    Records the status of the mojo connection between the Ash account manager
    and the Lacros account manager facade, when
    `AccountManagerFacade::GetAccounts()` is called. See

    expires_after="2023-01-31">
  <owner>sinhak@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>anastasiian@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Measures the time taken to fully initialize Chrome OS Account Manager. This
    is recorded once per user session, at login time. This metric only reports
    from Chrome OS, which has a high resolution clock.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="AccountManager.ManageAccountsServiceType"
    enum="GaiaServiceType" expires_after="2023-01-31">

    units="count" expires_after="2023-01-31">
  <owner>sinhak@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>anastasiian@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Tracks the number of Mojo pipe disconnections observed by the access token
    fetcher Mojo remote in `AccountManagerFacadeImpl`. This is logged at the end
    of the destruction of `AccountManagerFacadeImpl::AccessTokenFetcher`. This
    will correspond to the end of an access token fetch request. This is logged
    for Ash - ChromeOS and Lacros - ChromeOS.

  <owner>anastasiian@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Tracks the number of Mojo pipe disconnections observed by the
    `AccountManagerObserver` Mojo receiver in `AccountManagerFacadeImpl`. This
    is logged at the end of the destruction of `AccountManagerFacadeImpl`. Since
    `AccountManagerFacadeImpl` is a singleton, this is logged once per session
    (Per browser session for Lacros and per user session for Ash). This is
    logged for Ash - ChromeOS and Lacros - ChromeOS.
