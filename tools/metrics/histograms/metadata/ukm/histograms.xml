  <owner>rkaplow@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>ukm-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The actual interval between log upload start and previous log upload
    finished within the same process. A value of 0 indicates there was no
    previous upload.

    expires_after="2023-07-01">
  <owner>rkaplow@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>ukm-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Emitted when UKM Service attempts to build and store a log. Emits true if it
    was empty (no sources or entries) which means no log is written, false
    otherwise.

  <summary>
    Logged in UpdateUkmAllowedForAllProfiles from the UkmConsentStateObserver
    which is called when UkmConsentStateObserver starts observing a new profile
    and every time a URL-keyed anonymized data collection state changes or a
    sync service state changes. This records whether UKM is allowed for all
    profiles.

    Logged in the UpdateProfileState call from the UkmConsentStateObserver. This

    data.

    sent in the UKM log but truncated to 31 bits with &quot;event_hash &amp;
    0x7fffffff&quot;. Recorded when adding an entry and the UKM recorder decides
    it should be dropped.

  <summary>
    The hashed name of the UKM entry being dropped. The hash is the same hash
    sent in the UKM log but truncated to 31 bits with &quot;event_hash &amp;
    0x7fffffff&quot;. Recorded when adding an entry and the UKM recorder decides
    it should be dropped due to reaching the max number of sources allowed in
    memory.

    enum="UkmEventNameHash" expires_after="2023-05-05">
  <owner>lucnguyen@google.com</owner>
  <owner>ukm-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The hashed name of the UKM entry being dropped. The hash is the same hash
    sent in the UKM log but truncated to 31 bits with &quot;event_hash &amp;

    it should be dropped due to it being sampled out.

  <owner>yrsun@chromium.org</owner>

  <summary>
    Logged during UkmService initialization whether the init task or the initial
    log timer completed first. The expectation is the vast majority of the time,
    the init task should complete first. If metrics show otherwise, then it may
    indicate there's a bug in the UkmService init sequence and that it should be
    investigated.

<histogram name="UKM.IOSLog.OnSuccess" units="records"
    expires_after="2023-07-01">
  <owner>rkaplow@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Number of times when UKM.LogSize.OnSuccess was recorded on iOS. Recorded
    when the app transitions to the foreground. This histogram should help to
    figure out the root cause of crbug.com/1154678 (Data loss on UMA in iOS). If
    total count of UKM.IOSLog.OnSuccess is greater than number of
    UKM.LogSize.OnSuccess records, then data loss is caused by failure to write
    the histogram to the disk on background thread. Otherwise (if total sum of
    UKM.IOSLog.OnSuccess is equal to total count of UKM.LogSize.OnSuccess
    records) then there is actually no data loss and app simply gets terminated
    in a short window between UKM reached the server and the API call which
    records the data.
