    Android only.

    The number of times the tabbed mode of Chrome is launched within a given 24
    hour window. Recall that custom tabs is not considered tabbed mode. A
    &quot;launch&quot; here is defined as anytime the tabbed mode is made
    visible (foregrounded), but all Chrome activities must be completely hidden
    before we'll count an additional launch. It includes all kinds of intents,
    such as MAIN and VIEW. By ensuring all Chrome activities are hidden, we
    avoid overcounting by going to Settings and returning to Chrome.

    This launch definition includes some items one might not expect: (i) click a
    link in Chrome that opens in another app, then click back. (ii) have Chrome
    in the foreground, then the screen times out (goes blank) or engages the
    lock screen, then wake up/unlock the device. (iii) switch to
    &quot;Recents&quot;, then re-select Chrome. In all these cases, Chrome has
    gone to the background so returning to it counts as another launch.

    The value reported reflects activity over a 24-hour window in the past,
    possibly the distant past. Reporting is controlled by storing an initial
    launch timestamp and counting all &quot;launches&quot; as a count until a
    new launch happens after the 24hr window has elapsed (at this point, a new
    24hr window is started). The count is reported at the start of the next 24hr
    window, so this is a retroactive count. For example, if a user uses Chrome
    in one day two months ago, then doesn't use Chrome at all, then when Chrome
    launches today it'll report the value during that 24-hour window.
