    expires_after="2023-05-10">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>areimers@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the variance of the latencies of clock skew samples used for the
    computation of the clock drift. Only recorded for background fetches, which
    are enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default), and only
    recorded if clock drift is enabled via its feature parameter.

    units="microseconds/s" expires_after="2023-05-10">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>areimers@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the absolute value of the computed clock drift (time derivative of
    clock skew), when negative. Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default), and only
    recorded if clock drift is enabled via its feature parameter.

  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>areimers@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the absolute value of the computed clock drift (time derivative of
    clock skew), when positive. Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default), and only
    recorded if clock drift is enabled via its feature parameter.

    expires_after="2023-03-19">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the duration of the network round-trip performed to fetch the time
    from the network server. Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default).

    expires_after="2023-03-19">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the standard deviation of the last three fetch latencies (i.e. the
    durations of the last three network round-trip performed to fetch the time
    from the network server). Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default).

  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the absolute value of the computed clock skew (local clock - remote
    clock), when negative. Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default).

    Indicates whether the Finch configuration for the privacy budget
    identifiability study was validated successfully.
