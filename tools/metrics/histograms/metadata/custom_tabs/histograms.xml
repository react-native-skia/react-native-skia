  <summary>
    Android: This histogram is used as a means to count the total instances of
    Incognito custom tabs created meanwhile binning them across launching first
    party apps.

    The launching first party apps are inferred by the package name they
    provided when creating a custom tab connection and if we can't infer via
    package name then as a fallback we rely on them declaring
    EXTRA_APPLICATION_ID when launching Incognito custom tabs. If both fails,
    then the launch is recorded in the Others entry.

    This metric is never recorded for 3P apps.

    process and prepare resources for specific urls ahead of time via a service
    connection. This histogram can be used to cluster these metric differently.
