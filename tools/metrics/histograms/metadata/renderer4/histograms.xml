  <summary>
    The wall time elapsed between creating a raster task in the client and being
    ready to issue raster work to the driver in the GPU process. This includes
    time decoding and uploading images. Note that this does not count raster
    tasks that depend on at-raster image decodes. Since this metric is only
    reported for Chrome OS clients, it has data only from high-resolution
    clocks.

  <summary>
    Time spent completing all work for a compositor rasterization task. This
    includes the time in the renderer process for sending GL or paint commands
    to the GPU process and the time for flushing these commands to the driver.

    WARNING: This metric is only reported for clients with high resolution
    clocks, which means this will be biased to a portion of the population on

  <summary>
    This metric records the duration of an image decode for the raster path in
    the compositor. It is recorded every time we decode an image. It is suffixed
    by the type of rasterization we're in (either Gpu or Software). The
    rasterization suffix is optionally prefixed by the image type (WebP, Jpeg,
    etc.) or OutOfRaster.

    Warning: Before version M78 this metric may include reports from clients
    with low-resolution clocks (i.e. on Windows, ref.
    |TimeTicks::IsHighResolution()|). Such reports will cause this metric to
    have an abnormal distribution.

    Ideally we'd always scroll on the impl thread, but there are a variety of
    situations where we need to scroll on main. We should try to drive these
    down. For every gesture, we record whether the scroll occurred on the impl
    thread (&quot;Not scrolling on main (no reason)&quot;), or the main thread
    (&quot;Scrolling on main (any reason)&quot;) along with the reasons. There
    can be multiple main-thread reasons for each scroll, so the percentage of a
    reason shown in the UMA page is not the percentage of gesture scrolls with
    the reason in all gesture scrolls. The actual percentage of gesture scrolls
    with a reason would be count(the reason) / (count(&quot;Not scrolling on

    Ideally we'd always scroll on the impl thread, but there are a variety of

  <summary>
    The percentage of input events which are janks (not processed in the
    expected frame) during each momentum scroll gesture. Computed by tracking
    the number of extra coalesced momentum scroll events during a gesture. Extra
    coalesced event indicates that the events were not handled in the target
