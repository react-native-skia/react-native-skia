    the browser to viz when this API is being used, so viz will have points
    ahead of what the app provided the API, and they are used to draw the trail.

    Wall time is tracked by RendererScheduler.TaskDurationPerThreadType
    histogram. This histogram is used to compare CPU usage of tasks from
    different threads.

    Only 1% of randomly sampled tasks have cpu time measured and report duration
    for this histogram.

    Note that this metric discards tasks longer than 30 seconds because they are
    considered to be a result of measurement glitch.
