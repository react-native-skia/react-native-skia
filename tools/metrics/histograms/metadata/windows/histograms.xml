    Records if CET (Control-flow Enforcement Technology / Hardware Enforced
    Shadow Stack) is enabled or if it has been disabled by IFEO. Reported only
    if CetAvailable is true, once per browser session, on startup. Note: This
    was recorded incorrectly in M91.

    enum="CreateOrUpdateShortcutsResult" expires_after="2022-11-26">
  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jessemckenna@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The result of creating or updating a Windows shortcut out of process.
    Recorded when Chrome creates or updates a Windows shortcut using
    shell_integration::win::CreateOrUpdateShortcuts, e.g., when a profile is

  <summary>
    The number of drag events after a press event before we got a mouse move to
    0, 0 that is more than 200 pixels away from the current cursor position.
    This will be used to change the detection of spurious 0,0 move move events
    to a much smaller value (e.g., 20 pixels) but with the addition of a check
    that we've only received a few mouse move events, once we've determined the
    distribution of the number of drag events we receive before the 0,0 mouse
    move events. Recorded in HWNDMessageHandler::HandleMouseEventInternal when
    we see a mouse drag to 0,0 that is more than 200 pixels from the cursor
    position.

  <summary>
    Records whether or not the user unpinned Chrome after the installer pinned
    Chrome, on Win10+. Recorded when Chrome checks if Chrome is pinned to the
    taskbar, on startup. This check is currently done on 1% of startups. Records
    true if the installer pinned Chrome, and it's no longer pinned, false if the
    installer pinned Chrome and it's still pinned. The unpin is only recorded at
    most once per user, whereas the still pinned state is recorded on every
    launch that checks if Chrome is pinned to the taskbar.

    install was done after the installer started pinning Chrome to the taskbar
    for Windows 10+.

  <summary>
    Indicates if the current workspace state of a window is cached or not. If
    it's known that the window is on the current workspace or not, then we can
    avoid the COM method call IsWindowOnCurrentVirtualDesktop. This is recorded
    in BrowserView::IsOnCurrentWorkspace. In general, the state should almost
    always be cached.

<histogram name="Windows.OOPSelectFileDialog.ProcessError" enum="BooleanError"
    expires_after="M82">
  <owner>pmonette@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates whether a connection error occured between the browser and the

  <owner>brucedawson@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    A 32-bit value formed from combining the minor and patch level of the
    currently running Windows operating system as reported by GetVersionEx().
    E.g. &quot;Windows 10 OS Version 1809 (Build 17763.503)&quot; would be 17763
    (0x4563), combined with 503 (0x1F7) = 0x456301F7. If either minor or patch

  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dfried@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded each time the user starts a Windows touch drag drop of web
    contents. This is currently only used by the WebUI tab strip, where touch
    drag drop is enabled, to count the number of touch drags attempted.
    ::DoDragDrop occasionally blocks waiting for a right mouse button down
    followed by a move, which is detected by ::DoDragDrop not calling
    QueryContinueDrag for more than a second. This will be recorded as false.
    This stat will be used to determine how much of a real world problem this
    is.
