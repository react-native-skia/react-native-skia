    request sent to Omaha included a directive saying that a delta payload
    wasn't accepted. A &quot;Full&quot; payload is one where a delta payload was
    accepted but Omaha provided a full payload. This is reported every time the

    How many calendar(UTC) days that powerwash occurred before the date that the
    metric is recorded. The histogram is recorded on the next restart after
    powerwash. The purpose of this metric is to get the date when the powerwash
    happened. This histogram is 1 based instead of 0 based and 1 means the
    device was restarted immediately after powerwash completed. The value for
    marjority cases is 1, but some edge cases may greater than 1 which means the
    device was shutdown immediately (by user manually) after the powerwash
    completed and then restarted more than 1 days later. The powerwash date and
    the metric recorded date are all get from client device.
