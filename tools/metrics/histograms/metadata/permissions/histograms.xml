    Tracks user interactions on permission prompts, aggregated across all UI

    One sample is recorded each time a permission request triggers a prompt,

    include permission requests that are granted/denied because the user had
    previously made a decision; nor requests that are denied by Permission
    Policy, per-site permission embargo, or are cancelled while queued.

    The suffix of the histogram indicates which particular permission.

    For every permission request that would show a prompt to the user, this

    This is the proportion of permission prompts that the user would have seen
    that have been blocked due to embargo.

    If the (origin, permission) pair was previously placed under embargo, no
    prompt is displayed and the reason for embargo is recorded. Otherwise, the
    prompt is shown and a no embargo reason is recorded.
