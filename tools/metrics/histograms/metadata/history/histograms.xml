    Logged whenever history database initialization fails. The frequency of
    logging will tell you the total failure rate. True indicate that we think
    the database is non-recoverable and it will be deleted. It should be
    re-created the next time Chrome is started. False indicates we think the
    error is temporary (like out of disk space or file locked). Chrome will run
    with no history database and nothing will be done to try to fix the error.
    See History.InitializationFailureStep for which particular step of history
    initialization failed.

    This histogram records the total time taken to convert and process visits in
    all history cluster available. This is recorded once after the conversion,
    deduplication and sorting of the clusters. This is recorded using the
    highest precision clock possible. Like most time measurements this will not
    have the same behavior regarding system sleep on all platforms. See
    bit.ly/chrome-clocks-and-sleep for more details. Since the measurement is
    taken after the operation is over it will be missing if the operation never
    completes. This can happen if the user or the system shuts down chrome
    because of the unresponsiveness. A decidedly imperfect strategy to evaluate
    how often this happens is to compare total counts with another histogram
    that is recorded before the operation starts
    (&quot;History.Clusters.Backend.GetClusterLatency&quot;). Such analysis has
    to be conducted with care. Consult with Metrics team if curious.

    Records the time taken between the History Clusters UI requests a batch of

    from the service.

    This metric doesn't distinguish between any of these cases. This metric is
    recorded on all requests, whether or not it returns clusters.

    This does not take into account the time spent in JavaScript, or updating

    will be reported for that day.

    Warning about delayed data: Chrome may upload logs on a given day without
    uploading this histogram. This can happen because Chrome uploads logs
    initially upon startup. This histogram is emitted shortly _after_ startup.
    In the case of short sessions, it's possible the log with this histogram did
    not have time to be uploaded. Generally the log will be cached and uploaded
    the next time the user starts Chrome. We should still get one count per
    calendar day; it simply may not be on the day the metric was computed.
    (Exception: on Android before M-91, sometimes these emitted histograms were
    lost due to lack of robust &quot;background logging&quot;.)

    Note: for users syncing between multiple devices, this count may include
    some URLs/domains that weren't visited on this device. In other words, some
    domains may be counted for multiple client_ids even though they were only
    visited once, on one device. However, at this time (Feb 2020), only URLs
    navigated to via the omnibox (&quot;typed URLs&quot;) are synced, not all
    visited URLs. There are no plans to change this behavior. As such, because
    the mis-counting only occurs for users who are syncing across multiple
    devices and only for a subset of visited URLs, the effect of double-counting
    is likely to be small.
