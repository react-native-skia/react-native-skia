  <summary>
    Logged whenever history database initialization fails. The frequency of
    logging will tell you the total failure rate. True indicate that we think
    the database is non-recoverable and it will be deleted. It should be
    re-created the next time Chrome is started. False indicates we think the
    error is temporary (like out of disk space or file locked). Chrome will run
    with no history database and nothing will be done to try to fix the error.
    See History.InitializationFailureStep for which particular step of history
    initialization failed.

    Warning about delayed data: Chrome may upload logs on a given day without
    uploading this histogram. This can happen because Chrome uploads logs
    initially upon startup. This histogram is emitted shortly _after_ startup.
    In the case of short sessions, it's possible the log with this histogram did
    not have time to be uploaded. Generally the log will be cached and uploaded
    the next time the user starts Chrome. We should still get one count per
    calendar day; it simply may not be on the day the metric was computed.
    (Exception: on Android before M-91, sometimes these emitted histograms were
    lost due to lack of robust &quot;background logging&quot;.)

    Note: for users syncing between multiple devices, this count may include
    some URLs/domains that weren't visited on this device. In other words, some
    domains may be counted for multiple client_ids even though they were only
    visited once, on one device. However, at this time (Feb 2020), only URLs
    navigated to via the omnibox (&quot;typed URLs&quot;) are synced, not all
    visited URLs. There are no plans to change this behavior. As such, because
    the mis-counting only occurs for users who are syncing across multiple
    devices and only for a subset of visited URLs, the effect of double-counting
