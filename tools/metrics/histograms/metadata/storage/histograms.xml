  <owner>mek@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmurph@chromium.org</owner>

  <summary>
    Recorded when an error occurs in the FileReaderLoader, which is used to load
    blobs in the Renderer. FileReaderUser is mostly used for Javascript's
    'FileReader', but can also be used to read blobs for the IndexedDB

  <summary>
    Recorded when the blob system changes adjustment types on its disk size. The
    disk can either be Frozen, Adjusted (near min external available disk
    space), or Normal. We record when we transition between these states, which
    can happen after any file operations in the blob system (paging data to disk

  <summary>
    Recorded when we disable paging blobs to file in the blob storage system.
    This occurs when we experience a filesystem error during writing blob data
    to disk. We write blob data to files when either we have a new blob that's
    larger than our memory limit, or we're approaching our in-memory limit for
    blob storage. The relevant error is recorded here.
