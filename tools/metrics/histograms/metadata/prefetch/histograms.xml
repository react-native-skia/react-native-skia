    Cross-Origin prefetches requested via the Speculation Rules API are made in
    an isolated network context. When the prefetched link is navigated to, the
    cookies are copied from this isolated network context to the user's default

    This histogram records the time required to copy cookies from the isolated
    network context used for a prefetch to the user's default network context

    This histogram records the time required to read the cookies from the

    process is recorded to the
