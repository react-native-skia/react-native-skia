<histogram name="Security.ClientAuth.CertificateSelectionSource"
    enum="ClientCertSelectionResult" expires_after="2020-08-16">
  <owner>jdeblasio@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    When TLS client authentication is requested by the server, Chrome must
    choose whether to return a certificate or to abort the handshake. This
    histogram records how this determination was made, either as a result of
    user action, or as chosen automatically due to content settings. It only
    records when a fresh certificate selection would be attempted (and thus
    ignores cache hits). This histogram is recorded in SSLClientAuthObserver for
    user-selected outcomes and in ChromeContentBrowserClient for policy
    outcomes. This histogram does not cover mobile, as certificate handling is
    not handled by Chrome on Android nor iOS.

<histogram name="Security.DataDecoder.Image.DecodingTime" units="ms"
    expires_after="2023-03-05">
  <owner>lukasza@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>rsesek@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged once for every invocation of `data_decoder::DecodeImage` and/or
    `data_decoder::DecodeImageIsolated`. Logs the time that has elapsed while
    decoding the image (typically this happens in the Utility process). The time
    is recorded in all the cases (including empty input which don't require
    actual image decoding).
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Security.DataDecoder.Image.Isolated.EndToEndTime" units="ms"
    expires_after="2023-02-19">
  <owner>lukasza@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>rsesek@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged once for every invocation of `data_decoder::DecodeImageIsolated`.
    Logs the time that has elapsed between 1) invocation of DecodeImageIsolated
    and 2) calling the completion callback (both of these events happen in the
    Browser process). The elapsed time covers A) spawning the utility process,
    B) decoding the image, C) IPC overhead.

    Note that there are 2 sets of similar metrics:
    Security.DataDecoder.Image.Isolated. and
    Security.DataDecoder.Image.Reusable. In the Isolated case a Utility process
    is spawned for each image decoding operation and the ...End2End and
    ...ProcessOverhead metrics always include process spawning overhead. In the
    Reusable case a Utility process may get reused when decoding a batch of
    images, and the ...End2End and ...ProcessOverhead metrics may or may not
    include process spawning overhead (the process will only need to be spawned
    for the first image in a batch + after the process has been shut down due to
    inactivity).

    Logs the overhead of using a separate process for decoding the images by
