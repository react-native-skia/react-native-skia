  <summary>
    Records the size of the ColorProviderManager cache when a new ColorProvider
    is generated. New entries are generated when a client requests a
    ColorProvider with a Key that is not in the cache. Since the cache size is
    capped, a distribution with too many results at the tail indicate that the
    cache is too small.
