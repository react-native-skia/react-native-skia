    The stage during which Chrome was monitoring for browser crashes via the
    CleanExitBeacon when Chrome failed to exit cleanly. As a result of the
    Extended Variations Safe Mode work, Chrome monitors earlier on in startup
    for crashes. This metric allows early crashes detected due to this work to
    be distinguished from crashes that the original Variations Safe Mode could
    detect. Emitted during startup when the CleanExitBeacon is initialized.

    Note that the status quo monitoring stage refers to when crash monitoring
    would start in the absence of the new Extended Variations Safe Mode
    behavior, which (a) is later on in startup and (b) depends on the platform.

    An enum representing the sync consent status of all opened profiles during
    one UMA session. Recorded once in every ongoing metrics log; not recorded in
    logs about the previous session.

    This does not mean the user is actively syncing. Some common reasons for
    consent but not syncing: (i) user signed out of the web (which disables sync
    but doesn't remove consent for it so it will resume when the user signs in
    again) and (ii) user changed password and hasn't yet reauthenticated. There
    are a variety of rarer reasons as well. Examples: user disabled syncing for
    all sync data types but did not revoke consent, user enabled the sync
    passphrase and hasn't entered the passphrase in the current profile yet.

    recorded in logs about the previous session. System, Guest and Incognito
    profiles are ignored because the user cannot sign-in into them.

    Being signed into the browser means, for example, the user sees their Google
    account on the New Tab Page and in the toolbar at the top of the browser. It
    does NOT mean the user has a currently-valid token; they may need to refresh
    their credentials. As a concrete example, it means the user may not get
    personalized results and suggestions when using google.com.

    On desktop, when Chrome is running and there are no profiles with open
    browser windows (this can happen on Mac), this histogram will report
    &quot;Unknown sign-in status&quot;.

    On Android, when Chrome is running and there are no profiles with open
    browser windows (this can happen when Chrome is doing something in the
    background), it will report the sign-in status as if there were an open
    browser window.

    If a profile is open during the time period covered by this log record but
    closed before the log record is closed, the profile's status will not be
    reflected in this histogram.

  <summary>
    An enum representing the sync status of all regular profiles with open
    browser windows at the time a UMA log record is closed (i.e., excluding
    system and guest profiles). Recorded once in every ongoing metrics log; not
    recorded in logs about the previous session. System, Guest and Incognito
    profiles are ignored because the user cannot sign-in into them.

    If a profile is open during the time period covered by this log record but
    closed before the log record is closed, the profile's status will not be
    reflected in this histogram.

    Sync status indicates the profile has consented to sync and has a valid
    credential for the account (i.e., is signed-in), meaning sync in principle
    should be working. For example, if the user signs out of the web, their
    credentials will be put into an error state; they will not be valid. The
    profile will not be considered to be syncing. It is possible that the user
    is technically syncing (according to this histogram and Chrome) yet not
    syncing at that instant. Examples of this include (i) user is offline and
    (ii) user disabled syncing for all sync data types but didn't revoke
    consent.

    This is the pseudo {Metrics} metric. It's logged alongside with the real
    metric. The value of this pseudo metric is a linear function (ax + b) of the
    real value (x). The multiplicative factor (a) and additive factor (b) are
    controlled by field trial experiments. This metric is used for data
    validation and to help us better assess the accuracy and power of data from
    field trials.

  <summary>
    Sample rate applied to this client, expressed as number of clients per 1000
    that are in the sample. Recorded on every log upload but only if the client
    is eligible for sampling. (As of September 2019, the only clients eligible
    for sampling are Windows and Android installs on which the UMA checkbox was
    enabled by default.)

    Clients not eligible for sampling will not have this histogram recorded.

    Clients that are eligible for sampling but are sampled out (i.e., not
    uploading logs) will not have this histogram recorded. Notably, it will not
    appear in chrome://histograms! (Obviously, it also won't appear in the UMA
    logs because the client is not uploading logs.)

    Additional nuance, hopefully not important: the rate refers to the session
    that the log was generated in, not the session the log was generated about.
    This means when UMA uploads information about the last session (such as
    stability statistics), it is possible--though extremely unlikely--that the
    sampling rate config has changed from the previous session to the current
    one. As such, the sampling rate emitted in a previous-session log record may
    not be the right one that should've applied to that record.

    Intended to be used to estimate how many user actions are lost due lack of

    the previous session. All of those user actions will have been lost.

    Also note that user actions can be lost due to being truncated before
    uploading a UMA record. Those logs user actions are recorded in the
    histogram UMA.TruncatedEvents.UserAction.

    There may be other ways user actions are dropped too.
