    This is the pseudo {Metrics} metric. It's logged alongside with the real
    metric. The value of this pseudo metric is a linear function (ax + b) of the
    real value (x). The multiplicative factor (a) and additive factor (b) are
    controlled by field trial experiments. This metric is used for data
    validation and to help us better assess the accuracy and power of data from
    field trials.

  <summary>
    Sample rate applied to this client, expressed as number of clients per 1000
    that are in the sample. Recorded on every log upload but only if the client
    is eligible for sampling. (As of September 2019, the only clients eligible
    for sampling are Windows and Android installs on which the UMA checkbox was
    enabled by default.)

    Clients not eligible for sampling will not have this histogram recorded.

    Clients that are eligible for sampling but are sampled out (i.e., not
    uploading logs) will not have this histogram recorded. Notably, it will not
    appear in chrome://histograms! (Obviously, it also won't appear in the UMA
    logs because the client is not uploading logs.)

    Additional nuance, hopefully not important: the rate refers to the session
    that the log was generated in, not the session the log was generated about.
    This means when UMA uploads information about the last session (such as
    stability statistics), it is possible--though extremely unlikely--that the
    sampling rate config has changed from the previous session to the current
    one. As such, the sampling rate emitted in a previous-session log record may
    not be the right one that should've applied to that record.

    Emitted when a user action is recorded.

    Intended to be used to estimate how many user actions are lost due lack of
    being persisted in the same way histograms are. One way to use this
    histogram is to look as the count in this histogram in logs that come from
    the previous session. All of those user actions will have been lost.

    Also note that user actions can be lost due to being truncated before
    uploading a UMA record. Those logs user actions are recorded in the
    histogram UMA.TruncatedEvents.UserAction.

    There may be other ways user actions are dropped too.
