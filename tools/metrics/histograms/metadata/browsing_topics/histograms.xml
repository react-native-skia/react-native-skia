<histogram name="BrowsingTopics.BrowsingTopicsState.LoadFinishStatus"
    enum="BooleanSuccess" expires_after="2023-03-14">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the load finish status of BrowsingTopicsState. Recored when the
    state is loaded from the file at the start of each browser session.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="BrowsingTopics.EpochTopicsCalculation.CalculatorResultStatus"
    enum="BrowsingTopicsCalculatorResultStatus" expires_after="2023-03-14">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the browsing topics calculation result status (i.e. success, or the
    failure reason). Recored at the end of each (weekly) topics calculation.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="BrowsingTopics.EpochTopicsCalculation.EligibleDistinctHistoryHostsCount"
    units="hosts" expires_after="2023-03-14">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the count of distinct history hosts that are eligible for topics
    calculation. Recorded during each (weekly) topics calculation after the
    observation domains are derived. In case of a calculation failure (e.g.
    permission denied, etc.), this metric won't be recorded.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="BrowsingTopics.EpochTopicsCalculation.HistoryTopicsCount"
    units="topics" expires_after="2023-10-10">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the count of topics derived from history hosts in the past epoch
    (week). Recorded during each (weekly) topics calculation after the top
    topics are derived. In case of a calculation failure (e.g. permission
    denied, etc.), this metric won't be recorded.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="BrowsingTopics.EpochTopicsCalculation.ObservationContextDomainsCountPerTopTopic"
    units="context domains" expires_after="2023-03-14">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the count of context domains for each of the calculated top topics.
    This won't exceed the cap number
    `kBrowsingTopicsMaxNumberOfApiUsageContextDomainsToKeepPerTopic`. Recorded
    once for each calculated top topics, during each (weekly) topics calculation
    after the observation domains are derived. In case of a calculation failure
    (e.g. permission denied; candidate topic was blocked; etc.), this metric
    won't be recorded.
  </summary>
</histogram>

    units="topics" expires_after="2023-03-14">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the count of derived top topics before random ones are padded.
    Recorded during each (weekly) topics calculation after the top topics are
    derived. In case of a calculation failure (e.g. permission denied, etc.),
    this metric won't be recorded.
  </summary>

    expires_after="2023-09-08">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the time it takes for document.browsingTopics() to resolve. Recorded
    each time the promise is resolved.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="BrowsingTopics.SiteDataStorage.InitStatus"
    enum="BooleanSuccess" expires_after="2023-03-14">
  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records initialization status of BrowsingTopics SiteDataStorage database.
    Recored when the database is lazily initialised when the first operation is
    encountered.
