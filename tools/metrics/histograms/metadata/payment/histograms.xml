  <summary>
    Records whether the |GetDigitalGoodsService| method was called from a
    cross-site sub-frame. This metric is emitted when the cross-site check is
    made in the renderer, i.e. only when the payment method is non-empty and the
    script context is not being destroyed.

  <summary>
    Counts the number of Payment Requests (PR) that go through each checkout
    step. A single PR may be counted in multiple buckets depending on its final
    status. e.g. A completed PR will be counted in all of the following buckets
    1- Initiated, 2- show() called 3- Payment request triggered 4- Payment
    handler invoked, 5- Completed.

  <owner>web-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    A payment handler's response to the &quot;canmakepayment&quot; event in its
    service worker. The event is fired when &quot;new PaymentRequest()&quot; is
    called in JavaScript, but only for URL-based payment methods, only for
    already installed payment handlers, and only when not in private browsing
    mode. The response from &quot;canmakepayment&quot; is expected to be
    &quot;true&quot; in the majority of cases. The value of &quot;false&quot;
    could be either the payment handler refusing to make payments or an internal
    error, which should both be rare.

  <summary>
    An Android payment app's response to an IS_READY_TO_PAY intent. The intent
    is sent when &quot;new PaymentRequest()&quot; is called in JavaScript, but
    only for URL-based payment methods, only for apps that expose the
    IS_READY_TO_PAY intent to Chrome, only when Chrome is able to connect to the
    service at this intent filter, and only when not in private browsing mode.
    The response from IS_READY_TO_PAY is expected to be &quot;true&quot; in the
    majority of cases. The value of &quot;false&quot; could be either the
    payment app refusing to make payments or an internal error, which should
    both be rare.
