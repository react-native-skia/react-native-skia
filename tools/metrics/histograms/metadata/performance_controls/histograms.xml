<histogram name="PerformanceControls.BatterySaver.BubbleAction"
    enum="BatterySaverBubbleActionType" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>agale@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>estalin@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged on each battery saver mode bubble close indicating whether the bubble
    is dismissed (either by the user or by the system e.g. closed at shutdown)
    or used it to turn off battery saver mode for current session. This will be
    used to measure the efficacy of the bubble message and the number of users
    that interact with the battery saver toolbar button.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.BatterySaver.IPHOpenSettings"
    units="BooleanSettingsOpened" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>agale@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>estalin@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged each time the user opens the settings page through the link on the
    battery saver mode IPH. This will be combined with an existing histogram
    measuring the number of times the IPH is open to measure how the user
    responds to it.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.BatterySaver.SettingsChangeMode"
    enum="BatterySaverModeState" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>charlesmeng@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logs the state of the battery saver mode pref when the user makes a change
    to it through the settings page. This will be used to measure the
    discoverability and usefulness of battery saver mode.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.HighEfficiency.BubbleAction"
    enum="HighEfficiencyBubbleActionType" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>agale@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged on each high efficiency mode dialog close indicating whether the user
    opened the settings page or dismissed the dialog. This will be used to
    measure the efficacy of the dialog message and the number of users that
    interact with the high efficiency page action chip.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.HighEfficiency.InfoIPHOpenSettings"
    units="BooleanSettingsOpened" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>agale@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged each time the user opens the settings page through the link on the
    high efficiency mode IPH. This will be combined with an existing histogram
    measuring the number of times the IPH is open to measure how the user
    responds to it.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.HighEfficiency.IPHEnableMode"
    units="BooleanEnableMode" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>agale@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged each time the user enables high efficiency mode through the link on
    the high efficiency mode IPH. This will be combined with an existing
    histogram measuring the number of times the IPH is open to measure how the
    user responds to it.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="PerformanceControls.HighEfficiency.SettingsChangeExceptionList"
    enum="HighEfficiencyModeExceptionListAction" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>charlesmeng@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logs whether the user did an add, edit, or remove operation to the tab
    discard exception list for high efficiency mode. This will be used to better
    understand how users interact with the list, and to see if we need to
    improve our heuristics for tab discarding.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.HighEfficiency.SettingsChangeMode"
    enum="BooleanEnabled" expires_after="2023-03-01">
  <owner>charlesmeng@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-performance-ui-sea@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logs whether the user enabled or disabled the high efficiency mode pref when
    it is changed through the settings page. This will be used to measure the
    discoverability and usefulness of high efficiency mode.
  </summary>
</histogram>
