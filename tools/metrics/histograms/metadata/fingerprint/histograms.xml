  <summary>
    Counts the number of fingerprint attempts until successful screen unlock.

    A count of 0 means that the user unlocked the screen on the first attempt.
    The maximum number of unlock attempts is governed by kMaximumUnlockAttempts,
    such that this value must be less than the max.

    Counts the number of times that the fingerprint match successfully vs.
    rejected.

    ChromeOS only. Record when a fingerprint touch was ignored due to parallel
    power button press. Fingerprint matches will be ignored for a duration of
    kAuthIgnoreTimeoutmsecs (1000 ms) after each power button press. This only
    applies to fingerprint sensors that reside on a power button.

  <owner>hcyang@google.com</owner>
  <owner>tomhughes@google.com</owner>
  <owner>chromeos-fingerprint@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts the number of partial fingerprint attempts until successful result is
    reported in biod. Partial attempts refers to the &quot;low coverage&quot;
    error, which means that the sensor is only partially covered with a finger.
    It often occurs when the user just dropped their finger onto the sensor. We
    expect the user to adjust their finger position soon after that, so instead
    of reporting an error biod silently allows up to 20 retries for this kind of
    error. We want to observe in average how many partial attempts are needed
    before successfully matching.

    A count of 0 means that the fingerprint match attempt is successful without
    any preceding partial matches. The maximum number of partial attempts is
    governed by kMaxPartialAttempts, such that this value must be less than the
    max.
  </summary>

  <summary>
    ChromeOS Only. After a positive fingerprint match has been identified,
    record when a positive match secret is read from FPMCU. Note that this does
    not indicate that the match was was validated, only that the secret was
    read. Fingerprint.Unlock.Match.PositiveMatchSecretCorrect may be used to
    track validation.

<histogram name="Fingerprint.Unlock.RecentAttemptsCountBeforeSuccess"
    units="attempts" expires_after="2023-04-05">
  <owner>agrandi@google.com</owner>
  <owner>chromeos-fingerprint@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts the number of recent fingerprint attempts until successful screen
    unlock. Recent attempts are defined as happening within 3 seconds from each
    others. The goal is to count intentional attempt to unlock the device and
    exclude incidental touches of the fingerprint sensor.

    A count of 0 means that the user unlocked the screen on the first attempt.
    The maximum number of unlock attempts is governed by kMaximumUnlockAttempts,
    such that this value must be less than the max.

    This is related to Fingerprint.Unlock.AttemptsCountBeforeSuccess.
