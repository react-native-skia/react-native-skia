    Was a browsing session active when the UMA record was captured? This metric
    is recorded with every UMA log upload when the session tracker is running
    (which, in principle, should always be the case). This metric is NOT
    recorded in logs that reflect information from a previous session (i.e.,
    &quot;stability logs&quot; or &quot;persistent UMA&quot; data related to the
    previous session but not uploaded during the previous session).

  <summary>
    The length of a session (launch/foregrounding to quitting/backgrounding) in
    milliseconds, recorded at the end of the session. See
    Session.TotalDurationMax1Day for the same histogram with a higher maximum
    value. (The one's maximum is 1 hour.)

    Windows/Mac/Linux: A session ends (i) when the user puts another app in the
    foreground, unless audio is playing. (The Chrome windows can still be shown.
    What matters is that a different app has focus.) (ii) when Chrome quits.
    (iii) when the screensaver turns on (again, unless audio is playing). (iv)
    when the user is inactive for five minutes (again, unless audio is playing).
    In this case (starting in M-55), that five minutes is not included in the
    sesson length. (v) when audio stops playing, if the user has been inactive
    for five minutes or Chrome is not in the foreground. Also, until M69, there
    was a bug that caused double-counting of some sessions.

    ChromeOS: not implemented. The ChromeOS histogram Platform.DailyUseTime is
    somewhat similar.

    Android: Session boundaries are wonky. Thus, only look at total duration for
    a client over a day; don't look at individual durations. A session ends (i)
    when the Chrome app leaves the foreground. This sounds obvious yet there are
    many subtle though common edge cases here. Going to the Android Home screen
    via the Home button is an obvious case. Yet, merely pressing the Recents
    button, even if the user reselects the Chrome app (i.e., doesn't leave the
    app) also ends a session. Another set of cases is the screen time-out
    (blanking the screen) or the lock screen. Either will cause Chrome to be
    considered to leave the foreground, ending the session. (ii) some in-app
    actions. Yes, some in-app events trigger the end of a session.

    Android continued: These in-app actions that trigger the end of a session
    can mostly be considered bugs. Cases: (a) switching to viewing Bookmarks,
    History, Downloads, or Settings causes the session to end. Note that
    switching out of those modes does not cause the end of a session, only
    switching in. Oddly, though the interface looks similar, switching to Recent
    Tabs does not trigger the end of a session. Nor does going into the tab
    switcher view. (b) modal pop-ups. JavaScript dialogs and other things that
    take focus away from the Chrome activity can cause this metric to record a
    session end prematurely. See: crbug.com/678276. (c) switching Chrome from as
    a single app in the foreground into multi-window mode. (d) switching Chrome
    from being one of a set of multi-window apps that are displayed to be the
    only app displayed.

    iOS: A session starts when Chrome is launched to the foreground and ends
    when Chrome leaves the screen. This is generally straightforward. Chrome
    leaves the screen when the screen goes blank or shows the lock screen, when
    Chrome clicks a link that opens in another app, or when the user switches to
    another app in the app switcher. Note that, unlike on desktop, even if
    Chrome is playing media in the background or in picture-in-picture mode, the
    session is still terminated when Chrome leaves the screen. Also note that if
    Chrome starts in Safe Mode, the session will only start when the user quits
    Safe Mode. When multiple windows are used, the session is considered ongoing
    as long as there is at least one foreground Chrome window. This was revised
    in M-89 to support multiple windows. In M-87 and M-88, nothing was logged
    due to a bug. Before M-86, a similar metric was recorded, with some
    differences in edge cases. See the old histogram description for more
    details.

    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    This histogram is in the process of being replaced with the equivalent
    histogram Session.TotalDurationMax1Day.NotOptedInToSyncWithAccount; the only
    difference is the histogram bucket ranges.

    The amount of active browsing time that was spent with sync disabled while
    having a valid refresh token for the primary account. This corresponds to
    the case when the user did not opt in to sync, or sync is disabled due to
    another reason, e.g. enterprise policy. Note that auth errors are not
    counted here, but rather in
    Session.TotalDuration.OptedInToSyncWithoutAccount.

    This time is measured from when the user starts interacting with the browser
    until either they stopped interacting with the browser or their signin or
    sync status changes. These end-points are when the metric is emitted. For
    details on how &quot;stopped interacting with the browser&quot; is decided,
    see the description of Session.TotalDuration.

    Because a duration can end either because the user became inactive or
    because their status changed, the distribution of individual durations
    measured are unlikely to be helpful. Instead, please compare total
    durations.

    This metric is recorded on Win/Mac/Linux/iOS/Android.

    One caveat with this metric is that if the user has multiple profiles open
    at the same time, their session activity will be logged from all the
    profiles, instead of only from the profile that the user is using at that
    moment.

    Note: As part of crbug/1223007, we discovered this histogram was recorded
    for Guest and System profiles which wasn't intentional. This was fixed in
    M93.

    After launching background logging in the late February 2021 on Android,
    this metric started recording for instances that were running in the
    background, even if Chrome had never come to foreground. The bug was fixed
    in M92, and after that the metric is recorded only after an instance becomes

    The total session duration (see Session.TotalDuration) that was being spent
    with sync inactive due to an invalid refresh token for the primary account
    (a.k.a. sync in an auth error state). Note that in this state, the user has

    &quot;Sync paused&quot; state.

    This can for example be the case when a user, that previously opted in to
    sync, signed out of the web on desktop, changed their password, or otherwise
    invalidated their signin.

    One caveat with this metric is that if the user has multiple profiles open
    at the same time, their session activity will be logged from all the
    profiles, instead of only from the profile that the user is using at that
    moment.

    Note: As part of crbug/1223007, we discovered this histogram was recorded
    for Guest and System profiles which wasn't intentional. This was fixed in
    M93.

    After launching background logging in the late February 2021 on Android,
    this metric started recording for instances that were running in the
    background, even if Chrome had never come to foreground. The bug was fixed
    in M92, and after that the metric is recorded only after an instance becomes
    foregrounded at least once. Hence a glitch is visible in the Feb-Aug 2021
    data for Android.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@ and
    chrome-signin-team@. Do not change its semantics or retire it without
    talking to them first.

    The total session duration (see Session.TotalDuration) that was spent with

    Because a duration can end either because the user became inactive or

    The total session duration (see Session.TotalDuration) that was being spent
    with sync inactive due to an invalid refresh token for the primary account
    (a.k.a. sync in an auth error state). Note that in this state, the user has
    already opted in to sync previously. This corresponds to the so-called
    &quot;Sync paused&quot; state.

    This can for example be the case when a user, that previously opted in to
    sync, signed out of the web on desktop, changed their password, or otherwise
    invalidated their signin.

    This time is measured from when the user starts interacting with the browser
