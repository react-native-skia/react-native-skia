    The outcome of the first 6 auctions reported as bits, tracked per-page,

    corresponds to the least recent auction. An extra leading 1 is prepended --
    this allows reporting metrics when fewer than 6 auctions occurred during the
    page's lifetime. Therefore, the max value is 0b1111111 (7 bits, represents 6
    successful auctions), and the min value is 0b10 (represents a page that had
    1 failed auction), and every value in between is valid. Not updated for

    If the frame rate for the image animation can not be reached, frames in the
    animation are skipped to catch up to the desired frame. This metric tracks
    the number of frames skipped during catch up, and can be used to assess the
    smoothness of these animations. It records the number of frames skipped each
    time the animation is ticked forward to draw the next frame. In the ideal
    case, where the animation can be drawn at the desired rate, 0 frames should
    be skipped. Note that skipping of frames can also be triggered if the
    animation was intentionally paused (on becoming off-screen, or the tab being
    hidden).

  <summary>
    The amount of time it took to load the native libraries in {ProcessType}.

    In order to explain the nature of the uploaded samples for this histogram it
    is necessary to define a few core properties of the running processes.

    On Android 10 (=Q) a new feature was introduced and became used in Chrome:
    App Zygotes. An App Zygote (AZ) is a process pre-created by the system to
    allow faster initialization of isolated processes (IP) for a specific app.
    When AZ is created it runs the app-specific &quot;preload&quot; function
    once, and becomes idle, after that no work can be performed in the AZ other
    than getting forked. Whenever an app requests the Android Framework (AF) to
    provide an isolated process, the AF notifies the AZ to fork itself into a
    new process, which later will be provided to the app. An AZ created for one
    app (package) cannot be used for another app.

    The purpose of the AZ in Chrome is to load the native library - it avoids
    loading the same library in each isolated process separately.

    Capabilities of the AZ are very restricted. It runs in the same sandbox
    constraints as an isolated process, while also not having the ability to
    communicate with any other process on the system. Only after forking from
    the AZ the inherited process becomes able to communicate to the rest of
    Chrome.

    Beyond isolated processes, Chrome can request processes with more
    privileges: privileged processes (PP). In this case those processes will be
    forked from another zygote. There are several types of those zygotes, we
    will refer to them as Other Zygote (OZ) for simplicity. The decisions
    whether to start an isolated process through an AZ, and when to start a new
    AZ are made dynamically and depends on a few factors.

    The suffixes of this histogram, as described below, correspond to distinct
    execution scenarios:

    Suffix &quot;Browser&quot;: the native library is loaded in the main app
    process

    Suffix &quot;Zygote&quot;: OZ forks into AZ, AZ loads the native library, AZ
    forks into IP

    Suffix &quot;Child&quot;: OZ forks into PP, PP loads the native library

    Suffix &quot;Child&quot;: OZ forks into IP, IP loads the native library

    Suffix &quot;Child&quot;: OZ forks into AZ, AZ fails to load the native
    library, AZ forks into IP, IP loads the native library (this scenario should
    happen rarely).

    After library loading happens in the AZ, the recorded histogram value (for
    simplicity) gets copied to each child process forked from this AZ process
    and uploaded &quot;as if&quot; it is a unique sample from this child
    process. This leads to a discrepancy in sample counts.

    In early 2021-10 it had about 7% extra uploaded samples in
    &quot;ChromiumAndroidLinker.ZygoteLoadTime2&quot;.

    This differs from OffscreenCanvas.TextMetrics.SetFont in that it uses
    buckets up to ten seconds rather than ten milliseconds (due to a change in
    the underlying histogramming function called).

    Page load time for Browser-initiated navigations.

    Browser-initiated navigations include all navigations initiated by
    interacting with Chrome's UI elements, except for back/forward navigations.
    Specifically, typing a URL into the omnibox, tapping the reload button,
    loading a bookmark, and loading a page from the reading list (including when
    offline) are all considered browser-initiated. Additionally, background
    loads for prerendering and reading-list offline sync are also
    browser-initiated, as is a reload triggered by switching to a tab whose
    WKWebView renderer process was killed by the OS.

    This is recorded for successful main-frame navigations (that is, navigations
    that don't result in the browser displaying an error page). The recorded
    value measures the time from the navigation request being sent to the
    renderer process until all frames have fired their load events. For
    background loads, the same interval is measured while the page loads and
    fires load events in the background; the metric is not recorded again if the
    background-loaed page is later displayed in the foreground.

    Page loads that require network fetches will be slower than those where all
    necessary resources are already present in WebKit's HTTP cache. Reload
    navigations where all cached resources are up-to-date are particularly fast,
    since they don't require any rendering updates either.

    It is possible for a user to interact with a page before all load events
    have been fired, so the recorded value should not be interpreted as the time
    before the page becomes interactive.

    Most things that affect user-perceived page load time on iOS are within
    WebKit, not within Chromium/Chrome code. To assess whether a change in this
    metric is caused by a WebKit change, split by OS version. WebKit changes
    always come with an OS version change. Obviously, aside from WebKit and
    Chromium changes, this metric can move due to exogenous factors such as
    changes in what type of web page people are looking at or changes in the
    implementation of popular websites.

    Any navigation that is not considered browser-initiated is considered to be
    renderer-initiated (see PLT.iOS.RendererInitiatedPageLoadTime).

    Page load time for Renderer-initiated navigations.

    Renderer-initiated navigations are all main-frame navigations that are not
    considered to be browser-initiated (see
    PLT.iOS.BrowserInitiatedPageLoadTime). Specificially, tapping on links
    within web content, navigations triggered by JavaScript, navigations for
    restoring tabs on launch, and back/forward navigations are all considered to
    be renderer-initiated.

    This is recorded for successful main-frame navigations (that is, navigations
    that don't result in the browser displaying an error page). However, this is
    not recorded when WebKit handles a back/forward navigation using its page
    cache (that is, when the DOM representation of the destination is still
    loaded in memory from a recent visit), since we don't get the full set of
    WebKit navigation callbacks for such navigations. The recorded value
    measures the time from the browser process being notified that the
    navigation has started, to all frames having fired their load events. The
    time that the browser process is notified that the navigation has started is
    usually just after a network request is sent, but can be later for
    back/forward navigations on sites that use pushState to generate history
    entries; in the latter case, the navigation may be almost finished by the
    time the browser finds out about it. As such, depending on the cause of the
    navigation, different things are measured. Some types will be very fast
    (e.g., pushState/replaceState) and others (such as tapping on links) will be
    slower. Furthermore, navigations that require network fetches will be slower
    than those where all necessary resources are already present in WebKit's
    HTTP cache.

    arrive to the RenderFrameHostImpl after the RenderFrameHostImpl had already
    committed the next cross-document navigation.

    This means that |document_scoped_interface_provider_binding_| was already
    unbound at the time from the interface connection that had been used to
    service RenderFrame::GetRemoteInterface for the previous load, so those
    interface requests are dropped.

    Counts how many languages are added to Chrome by the user but are not

    This is a measure of the potential impact of adding support for non-Hunspell
    locales in the spell check settings. This also helps answer the following
    question: should the Chrome spell check settings raise awareness of Windows
    language packs and / or link to documentation describing how to install a
    Windows language pack?

    This is recorded once during spell check initialization, and then once each
    time the user changes their Chrome languages.
