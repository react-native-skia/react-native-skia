    Amount of space, in MB, that is available on the Borealis VM disk when a
    client requests for more space. This is recorded each time a client makes a
    valid RequestSpace request.

    The results of a &quot;GetDiskInfo&quot; request from a client, which will
    either be a success or an error. This is recorded each time a client makes a

    The number of requests made by a client within a session of Borealis. This
    counts each time a client makes a disk related request (GetDiskInfo,
    RequestSpace and ReleaseSpace) and is emitted when Borealis is shutdown.

    Amount of space, in MB, that is freed by the client (via a
    &quot;ReleaseSpace&quot; request). This is recorded each time a client makes
    a ReleaseSpace request. This is not necessarily the amount of space that the
    host frees, it is just the amount that the client signals as free.
