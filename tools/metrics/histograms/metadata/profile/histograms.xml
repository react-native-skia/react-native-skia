    Classification of what account categories out of {consumer, enterprise}
    appear or appeared in this profile since the last time gaia cookies got
    deleted. Thus, this also includes signed-out accounts. If both categories
    appeared, it also distinguishes whether sync is enabled and for which of

  <summary>
    Classification of what gaia names appear or appeared in this profile since
    the last time gaia cookies got deleted. Thus, this also includes signed-out
    accounts. In order to protect privacy, only reports whether multiple
    distinct gaia names appeared in this profile and if so, whether sync is
    enabled for one of them. Furthermore, this metric uses a low-entropy hash to
    detect distinct names. In case of a rare hash collision (less than 0.1% of
    cases), multiple names get recorded as a single name. Recorded on every
    activation of a Chrome window (for the respective profile).

    Recorded every time a browser window becomes active. Each profile on a

    Example: A user has 2 profiles and opens 1 browser window for each of them.
    When the user switches back and forth between the windows, multiple entries
    will be recorded in bucket 1 and 2, corresponding to the profiles.

    Note: The guest profile has bucket 0. Regular profiles start at bucket 1.

    The histogram gets recorded for every signed-in profile creation flow where
    the user enables sync right in the flow. In this case, Chrome needs to check
    theme sync before showing a profile customization bubble. The recorded value
    is the delay between the moment sync consent is given and the moment Chrome
    decides whether to show the customization bubble (if the consent is given in
    the profile creation flow, the start of the measured interval is actually
    when a new browser window opens after the consent is given).

  <summary>
    Helper histogram to track user actions per profile. Recorded when there is
    an active profile browser instance and a UMA UserAction is recorded, i.e. if
    there's an active profile, a recording of a UMA UserAction will result in a
    recording of a sample in this histogram.

    Each profile on a client is assigned a unique bucket, i.e. whenever a user
    action happens in a browser of profile x, an entry is recorded in bucket x.

    This histogram is used in the profile dashboard, see go/profile-metrics and
    go/profile-metrics-dashboard.

    Example: A user has 2 profiles and opens a browser window for each of them.
    When the user adds a new tab in each of the browsers, an entry is recorded
    in bucket 1 and 2, corresponding to the profiles. (Adding a new tab is a
    recorded user metrics action.)

    Note: The guest profile has bucket 0. Regular profiles start at bucket 1.
    Incognito profiles count towards the original profile.
