    Classification of what account categories out of {consumer, enterprise}
    appear or appeared in this profile since the last time gaia cookies got
    deleted. Thus, this also includes signed-out accounts. If both categories
    appeared, it also distinguishes whether sync is enabled and for which of

  <summary>
    Classification of what gaia names appear or appeared in this profile since
    the last time gaia cookies got deleted. Thus, this also includes signed-out
    accounts. In order to protect privacy, only reports whether multiple
    distinct gaia names appeared in this profile and if so, whether sync is
    enabled for one of them. Furthermore, this metric uses a low-entropy hash to
    detect distinct names. In case of a rare hash collision (less than 0.1% of
    cases), multiple names get recorded as a single name. Recorded on every
    activation of a Chrome window (for the respective profile).

    Recorded every time a browser window becomes active. Each profile on a
    client is assigned a unique bucket, i.e. whenever a browser window of
    profile x becomes active, an entry is recorded in bucket x.

    Example: A user has 2 profiles and opens 1 browser window for each of them.
    When the user switches back and forth between the windows, multiple entries
    will be recorded in bucket 1 and 2, corresponding to the profiles.

    Note: The guest profile has bucket 0. Regular profiles start at bucket 1.
    Incognito browser windows count towards the original profile.

  <summary>
    Helper histogram to track user actions per profile. Recorded when there is
    an active profile browser instance and a UMA UserAction is recorded, i.e. if
    there's an active profile, a recording of a UMA UserAction will result in a
    recording of a sample in this histogram.

    Each profile on a client is assigned a unique bucket, i.e. whenever a user
    action happens in a browser of profile x, an entry is recorded in bucket x.

    This histogram is used in the profile dashboard, see go/profile-metrics and
    go/profile-metrics-dashboard.

    Example: A user has 2 profiles and opens a browser window for each of them.
    When the user adds a new tab in each of the browsers, an entry is recorded
    in bucket 1 and 2, corresponding to the profiles. (Adding a new tab is a
    recorded user metrics action.)

    Note: The guest profile has bucket 0. Regular profiles start at bucket 1.
    Incognito profiles count towards the original profile.

  <summary>
    Number of Profiles that are in a &quot;zombie&quot; state. Recorded 30
    minutes after startup, and every 30 minutes afterwards. Only regular
    Profiles are considered for this metric (no Incognito, Guest, or System
    Profiles). A &quot;zombie&quot; profile is one of 2 things, depending on the
    DestroyProfileOnBrowserClose (DPoBC) variation:

    If DPoBC is false: the Profile has a refcount of 0, but is still loaded in
    memory.

    If DPoBC is false: the Profile object was destroyed, and isn't loaded in
    memory anymore.

    When a Profile is destroyed but gets loaded from disk again, it stops being
    a zombie.

    See also Profile.LiveProfileCount, the number of profiles with a non-zero
    refcount.

    Measure the elapsed time from when the user selects a profile on the startup
    profile picker to the first non empty paint of the first web contents. This
    is recorded when the user selects an existing profile from that profile

    Together with ProfilePicker.StartupTime.FirstPaint.FromApplicationStart,
    this metric is intended to capture the startup latency for a common case
    where Startup.FirstWebContents.NonEmptyPaint3 is not recorded due to the
    profile picker interrupting browser startup.
