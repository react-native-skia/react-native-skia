    The number of iterations that was required to initialize Direct Write. This
    metric is recorded by the browser process at startup. The value -1 is
    reported when the initialization failed. The fallback path using GDI is used
    instead of DWrite.

    ratio of empty per-family results to all per-family results as percentage.
    Recorded in DWriteFontTableBuilder at the time of finishing scanning the
    font files for their name meta information. A value of 100% means, all
    per-family scan tasks came back empty. A value of 0% means, all per-family
    tasks yielded at least one font file. Used for diagnosing

    done reading from cache or when the table construction is ready. This metric
    includes a scheduling delay from when the task to read from cache or build
    is scheduled, untils its execution, while
