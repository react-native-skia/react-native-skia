  <summary>
    Samples of user interactions with the Data Reduction Proxy promos, First Run
    Experience, main menu footer, and settings menu. All samples are mutually
    exclusive. These samples include:

    The user interactions with the First Run Experience. On Android when the
    user sees the FRE card, the Data Reduction Proxy defaults to ON. The user
    can disable the proxy via a switch on the card. The state of the proxy is
    sampled when the First Run Experience is completed and only reported if the
    Data Reduction Proxy card was shown.

    The user interactions with the second run promo. On Android, there are two
    actions that dismiss this promo (enable or dismiss). This is sampled when
    the promo leaves view.

    The user interactions with the Infobar promo. On Android, there are two
    actions that dismiss the promo (enable, dismiss). This is sampled when the
    promo leaves view.

    The user interactions with the Snackbar promo. The user can either ignore
    the promo or click the action to the settings menu. From the settings menu,
    the user may enable or disable the proxy.

    The user interactions with the main menu footer. The user can click the
    footer to enter the settings menu. From the settings menu, the user may
    enable or disable the proxy.

    Any other user interaction with the ON/OFF switch in the settings menu for
    reducing data usage. Only the setting changes between entering the reducing
    data usage setting menu and leaving the menu will be sampled regardless of
    how many times they toggle the ON/OFF switch. Other samples that report
    ON/OFF settings menu changes are not also reported here.

    The views of and user interactions with the site breakdown in the settings
    menu. The site breakdown can be sorted by data saved descending or data used
    descending, and expanded to view more sites. The Data Reduction statistics
    can also be reset.
