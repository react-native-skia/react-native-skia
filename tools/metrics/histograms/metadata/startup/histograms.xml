    The process can only be created in response to a user action, either tapping
    the icon, tapping a link that opens in Chrome, or using the app switcher to
    switch to Chrome after it has been background-killed by the OS.

    The metric is recorded at the point where the Chrome window starts receiving
    input events like touches and keypresses. However, the Chrome splash screen
    is showing at this point, so there aren't any UI elements for a user to
    interact with.

    It includes code loading, static initializers and the execution time
    contained in Startup.ColdStartWithExternalURLTime and
    Startup.ColdStartWithoutExternalURLTime metrics.

    The total counts in this histogram can be compared with the number of emits
    to the user action MobileWillEnterForeground. The former reports the number
    of cold starts. The latter is only recorded when Chrome comes to the
    foreground on non-cold starts.

    process. On Android, the application start is the time at which the Java
    code starts. On Windows, application start is when chrome.exe:main starts,
    before chrome.dll is loaded. On other platforms, it is when
    ChromeMainDelegate is constructed.
