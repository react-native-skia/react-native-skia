  <summary>
    The time from Chrome tabbed activity creation to the moment the Chrome first
    appears ready.

    This metric captures when the omnibox is painted and either a navigation has
    committed or a Paint Preview is shown. The intent is to reflect Clank's
    perceived cold start performance regardless of different launch paths, while
    controlling for the factors that we have the most direct influence over and
    minimizing external factors. Note that network connectivity is mostly but
    not entirely omitted as it does impact the initial response time for a site
    which impacts the omnibox UX and loading metric.

    This metric captures the value of the first emitted metric out of the
    'Startup.Android.Cold.TimeToFirstNavigationCommit.Tabbed' and
    'Browser.PaintPreview.TabbedPlayer.TimeToFirstBitmap' metrics and emits the
    value.

    This metric is only recorded once per application lifetime during cold
    startup i.e. when Chrome's native library is not loaded at first activity
    creation. Specifically, it is recorded for the first foreground committed
    http(s) URL in the primary frame if that first navigation is not: an error,
    same-document navigation, or fragment navigation.

    This metric is expected be stable from milestone to milestone. Updating
    Chrome or the Android system image on the device are expected to result in a
    noticeable slowdown on the first cold startup after. The total counts
    changes for this histogram are not of significant importance; however, a
    non-trivial increase in total counts could signal more background kills, for
    example.

    This metric is not recorded:

    - If another navigation occurs before the first navigation commit and the
    Paint Preview show.

    - If the navigation is pre-warmed, is a background navigation, or fails to
    be committed (e.g. cancelled, network error, or error due to lack of
    connectivity).

    - If the activity was ever backgrounded between activity creation and this
    metric reporting.

    - If the app opens to the Chrome Start page.

    - For WebApps, PWAs or WebApks.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    Android: The time from the activity creation point to the moment the content

    Not to be mistaken with the Startup.Android.Cold.TimeToFirstVisibleContent

    The duration of all initializations from process creation time to UI ready

    The process can only be created in response to a user action, either tapping
    the icon, tapping a link that opens in Chrome, or using the app switcher to
    switch to Chrome after it has been background-killed by the OS.

    The metric is recorded at the point where the Chrome window starts receiving
    input events like touches and keypresses. However, the Chrome splash screen
    is showing at this point, so there aren't any UI elements for a user to
    interact with.

    It includes code loading, static initializers and the execution time
    contained in Startup.ColdStartWithExternalURLTime and
    Startup.ColdStartWithoutExternalURLTime metrics.

    The total counts in this histogram can be compared with the number of emits
    to the user action MobileWillEnterForeground. The former reports the number
    of cold starts. The latter is only recorded when Chrome comes to the

    Measure the elapsed time from the application start to the first non empty
    paint of the first web contents. Only comprised of cases where the initial
    foreground tab gets to complete its rendering task unimpeded (an improvement
    over Startup.FirstWebContents.NonEmptyPaint).

    Application start is a time recorded as early as possible in the startup
    process. On Android, the application start is the time at which the Java
    code starts. On Windows, application start is when chrome.exe:main starts,
    before chrome.dll is loaded. On other platforms, it is when
    ChromeMainDelegate is constructed.

    Do not modify this metric in any way without contacting
    chrome-analysis-team@google.com.
