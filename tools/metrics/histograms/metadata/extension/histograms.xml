    For each www.google.com pageload, the number of extensions that create
    iframes to add to the page.

  <owner>extensions-core@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of extensions that were blacklisted when already installed,
    grouped by Extension::Location. Logged when ExtensionService blackists and
    unloads an installed extension.

    a blacklisted extension without blocking it (ExtensionBlacklist.BlockCRX

    blacklisted extension synced.

  <summary>
    The time taken to create the computed_hashes.json file for an extension.
    This happens once for each extension after we get signed values of the
    expected root node of a tree hashes for each file from the webstore; we then
    compute the individual block level hashes of the actual files and cache them
    in computed_hashes.json (assuming we don't detect any mismatches).

  <owner>lazyboy@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>extensions-core@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The time taken to initialize the ContentHashReader for an extension resource
    load. (The work done is to read in the verified contents and computed hashes
    data, and compare them to make sure they agree.)

    Warning: This metric may include reports from clients with low-resolution
    clocks (i.e. on Windows, ref. |TimeTicks::IsHighResolution()|). Such reports
    will cause this metric to have an abnormal distribution. When considering
    revising this histogram, see UMA_HISTOGRAM_CUSTOM_MICROSECONDS_TIMES for the
    solution.

    When fetching a chrome-extension:// URL, this indicates the first byte
    position we read from. This will be greater than 0 in cases such as XHR's
    with a Range header, but will normally be 0 in the typical case of reading
    the entire file. This helps identify how frequently partial file reads are
    taking place.
