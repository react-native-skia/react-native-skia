This file is used to generate a list of obsolete histograms along with a
detailed description for each histogram.

This was auto-generated from the split_xml.py script which splits out previously
obsolete histograms. Users don't need to move newly marked obsolete histograms
into this file.

In other words, when marking an existing histogram as <obsolete>, it's fine
to leave the histogram in its existing file in one of the metadata
 subdirectories.

For best practices on writing histogram descriptions, see

    When a user closes a tab an undo toast will popup on certain devices giving
    the user the chance to undo closing that tab. This stat tracks how the user
    interacts with that UI and what actions they take. A cold start means that
    the undo bar wasn't showing when it was triggered to show again. A warm
    start means that it was. Warm starts can happen when the user closes
    multiple tabs close together. When the undo bar is dismissed, all closes
    that were queued up to be undone are committed. This can happen either by a
    timeout or by an action by the user to move to another part of the UI.

    Records how forms change dynamically: whether the form signature changed, a
    field's signature changed, or a field was newly created. The reference
    period starts when Autofill parses the form for the first time, and ends
    when a navigation is committed or the frame is destructed.

    Every form is observed for dynamic changes from the time it was first parsed
    by Autofill until either a navigation has been committed or the frame is
    destructed or the form's observation had to be flushed prematurely (the form
    observations are managed in an LRU cache of maximum size 32, with least
    recently parsed forms being discarded first). At the end of the lifetime, a
    three-bit number is sent: the lowest bit is 1 iff a field was changed during
    the form's lifetime (its signature changed); the second bit is 1 iff a field
    was added (its renderer ID is new to the form); the highest bit is 1 iff the
    form was changed (its signature changed).

    Autofill form events for credit card forms. These are recorded when the user
    interacts with a form requesting a credit card, a dropdown of suggestions is
    shown and at least one of the suggestions has a bank name. Form events are
    logged at most once per page load.

    These metrics are used to measure the impact of the bank name experiment.
    They are used to calculate the CTR of the autofill UI with bank names
    available. Not all credit cards will have bank names even if we launch the
    experiment. With these metrics we can run the experiment on 2 groups. For
    one group, we will show bank names if available. For the other, we won't
    shown.

    When Chrome tries to access the user's Address Book, OSX presents a blocking
    dialog which disrupts the user experience. A new Chrome feature has been
    introduced wherein Chrome only shows this blocking dialog if the user
    explicitly asked Chrome to access the user's Address Book. If a form's field
    looks like it might support Autofill suggestions from the user's Address
    Book and there are no other suggestions, Chrome shows an Autofill entry that
    prompts the user to give Chrome access to the user's Address Book. This

    In addition, metric values from OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob API call are

    tasks on either main or worker thread.

    The number of images which could have been checkered (async decoded) for a
    performance gain, split by the DOM element type on which they were used.
    This is recorded each time an image for an element created by the page is
    loaded, either from the network or the local cache. The browser heuristics
    define an image to be checkerable if it is expected to have a long decode
    duration. Since these images may be on the rendering critical path, decoding
    them asychronously from painting other content can provide better
    performance be reducing overall content checkerboarding.

    When either a pre-resolution was not done recently enough to provide
    benefit, or the corresponding pre-resolution is still pending, this
    histogram shows the duration of the duration of time used to resolve a
    hostname to navigate to (GET) a URL. In newer versions, if the hostname has
    never been found as a link during a page scan, and it has a referring URL,
    then it is added to referrer list data structure (hoping we'll do better
    next time).

    Measures the difference between the current transmit power and the maximum
    transmit power of the local device when the user successfully unlocks or

    Devices connected using classic Bluetooth adjust their transmit power
    dynamically to optimize power and signal strength. The difference between
    the current transmit power and maximum transmit power can be used as a
    heurstic to determine if the phone is close to the local device.

    According to the Bluetooth specs, there are three classes of devices, with a
    maximum transmit power of 20, 4, and 0 dBm respectively.

    If no transmit power was read, then a sentinel value of 127 will be

    Records the Chrome channel when JavaScript exceptions are not gracefully

    canary and dev, because we try *not* to suppress errors and instead kill the
    renderer and generate a crash report. However, at times we need to suppress
    even those. Note that this histogram is intended to be tracked over time,

    When a mojo audio stream factory is destructed, the streams it created are
    also destructed. This is a potential source of stat differences between the
    new mojo code and the old Chrome IPC code, where streams could potentially
    stick around until the destruction of the owning RenderProcessHost. This

    Reflects how regularly browser issues audio requests to renderer. Depends on
    how well the system buffer size the browser side renders audio at and the
    buffer size it requests from renderer are aligned. When zero, it means
    renderer buffer size is a multiple of system buffer size, and render calls
    from browser to renderer are issued evenly. When -1, it means the renderer
    buffer size is larger than system buffer size, but is not an exact multiple
    of it; in this case browser periodically skips a call to renderer. When
    positive, floor(value/2) reflects the number of extra consecutive render
    requests issued by browser to renderer each time to fulfill the system audio
    render request; if (value/2) is not integer, then plus one more extra call
    is issued periodically. The metric is recorded on the edge between browser
    and renderer. On Mac the system buffer size may vary dynamically, the metric
    does not capture that: only the buffer size mismatch introduced by audio
    output device configuration is captured.

  <summary>
    Confusion matrix for MediaCapabilities local learning experiment, using a
    lookup table and the base MediaCapabilities features (resolution, frame
    rate, video format). A positive outcome is smooth playback, while a negative
    outcome is not smooth. For example, a False Negative indicates that we
    predicted a negative result (not smooth playback), but we later observed
    that the result was positive (smooth playback).

    For those observations for which we could not make a prediction due to data
    sparsity, the &quot;no-prediction&quot; buckets indicate whether the
    observation was positive or negative.

    This is very similar to the existing MediaCapabilities implementation, but
    uses the same training set as other learners.

    The &quot;BaseTable&quot; variant uses a lookup table as the model, and uses
    the original MediaCapabilities features (resolution, frame rate, video
    format).

    The &quot;BaseTree&quot; variant uses ExtraTrees model and the same features
    as the BaseTable variant.

    The &quot;EnhancedTree&quot; variant uses ExtraTrees, plus additional
    features such as NetworkType. The exact set of features is still in flux, so
    be sure to restrict reporting to a particular Chromium version.

    This records the frequency with which JavaScript source strings are
    compressed and decompressed in foreground and background tabs. Compressing
    runs 10 seconds after the tab goes background and decompressing runs when
    JavaScript source string is required (e.g. V8 starts to compile). This
    measurement is a preparation to introduce CompressibleString class for
    JavaScript source strings to reduce Blink memory usage.

  <summary>
    Proxy Auto Config (PAC) allows specifying an arbitrary javascript program to
    pick network proxies on a per-request basis (based on the URL). This works
    by calling the script's FindProxyForURL() function with the target URL as
    its first argument.

    Traditionally, the URL parameter passed into the script contains the exact
    URL being loaded, except maybe for having stripped the fragment and embedded
    identity portions of the URL.

    This histogram records what happens when the URL passed into
    FindProxyForURL() additionally has had its path component stripped. Does it
    return the same proxy list as when calling FindProxyForURL() with the
    original (unmodified) URL?

    This comparison is done only when the URL scheme implies a secure channel
    (i.e. https:// and wss://), in order to gather data for crbug.com/593759.

    When a preconnection is made, indicate what the motivation was.

    Currently, the most common (only?) motivations are SELF_REFERAL,
    LEARNED_REFERAL and OMNIBOX. The SELF_REFERAL indicates that we made sure a
    second connection was available for a resource that either was never before
    seen, or has historically had no subresources. The LEARNED_REFERAL indicates
    that we &quot;learned&quot; that a subresource was commonly needed, and that
    motivated the TCP/IP preconnect. The OMNIBOX motivation happens when a
    search is being suggested, and we preconnect to the search provider.

    Whether proxy resolution occured by forwarding the request to the proxy
    resolver and executing the PAC script. This histogram records all URLs,
    regardless of whether a proxy configuration is set. Note that in some cases,
    the system proxy resolver is used. If so, this histogram indicates whether
    the request was forwarded to the system resolver. However, on desktop
    platforms, the number of users using the system resolver should be small
    since the default is to use V8. Hence, the count of emissions to the 'True'
    bucket on desktop caused by users of the system resolver should be small.

    In this experiment, 21 packets were sent to Google via UDP at port 6121 as
    rapidly as possible, just after successfully sending an UMA upload. If no
    packets (of the 21) were ever ACKed, then the port is assumed to be blocked.
    The histogram shows if we ever got an ACK for a packet in our series of 21.

    Records number of times an Answer is presented as one of the Omnibox

    is logged every time the omnibox is exited, including when no answer is
    present in the list of suggestions.

    Nota bene: in some circumstances this histogram is double counting on
    purpose. Scenarios cover repetitive actions that expose same answer
    suggestion, ie. leave-enter-leave application, or leave-enter-clear where no
    new suggestion fetches are done.

    This histogram assumes that no more than 1 AiS suggestion is shown at a
    time, which was enforced by the backend at the time the histogram was
    created. Additional histogram/s may be required to properly track how
    frequently answers are shown in general - and in what quantity.

    Whether the user has settings configured so that the current page URL can be

    engine (unmodified version of Google), have search suggest enabled, are
    signed-in and syncing without a custom passphrase, and don't have an
    incognito window open. There are other criteria too. Recorded on focus in
    the omnibox if there is default search provider and we've constructed a
    suggest URL.

    Some additional guidelines: if an incognito window is open, all focus events
    will go into the &quot;generally ineligible&quot; bucket. Likewise, if the
    current page is a search results page, we don't allow contextual suggestions
    either so focus events on those pages go in the &quot;generally
    ineligible&quot; bucket. The difference between &quot;eligible&quot; and
    &quot;generally eligible but not this time&quot; depends only the properties
    of the current URL.

    Recorded regardless of whether contextual or non-contextual zero suggest is
    currently enabled on the user's platform. However, if zero suggest (in all
    forms) is entirely disabled, the user will be perpetually ineligible.

    A request is when a website makes a permission request and the user has the
    permission set to prompt (i.e. not blocked or allowed).

    Note this is probably not the metric you want - it does not correspond to
    the total number of times websites request a permission. Also, because
    specific permissions have code that can automatically block or grant
    permissions based on things like incognito, installed extensions etc., this
    does also not correspond to the number of times users are prompted to allow
    permissions.

  <summary>
    Retries needed to enable a FET on tps65090 (AKA tpschrome). Tps65090 is a
    power management unit (PMU) used on many ARM Chromebooks. Until version ES7
    was rolled into production we would sometimes run into a problem where FET1
    (the FET used to switch on and off the backlight) wouldn't turn on properly.
    This problem was especially prevalent when the voltage was high (like when
    the device was plugged into the wall). Retrying by turning the FET off and
    on again is nearly always effective, so the kernel will retry up to 5 times
    (currently) and will also log the fact that it needed to retry. On newest
    kernels (kernel 3.8 and up) a kernel warning will be logged with WARN_ON if
    the FET still failed to turn on after 5 tries. Refer to the kernel warning
    reports to find that information. For more details about this bug refer to
    http://crbug.com/338657 and http://crosbug.com/p/16009. Note that we log
    retries on all 7 FETs even though we've only ever seen failures of FET1.

  <summary>
    The time taken for the browser to find and possibly start an active worker
    to dispatch a FetchEvent for a main frame resource request. BEWARE: This
    metric includes the time taken for redirects. It starts when the URLRequest
    is created, and ends when the worker is ready. For context, a FetchEvent can
    only be dispatched to an ACTIVATED worker that is running (it has been
    successfully started). The measurements starts when the browser process
    receives the request. The browser then finds the worker appropriate for this
    request (if there is none, this metric is not recorded). If that worker is
    already started, the browser process can send the request to it, so the
    measurement ends quickly. Otherwise the browser process has to start the
    worker and the measurement ends when the worker is successfully started (we
    do not include in the time it takes for the worker to become ACTIVATED). The
    metric is not recorded in the following situations: 1) The worker was in
    state INSTALLED or ACTIVATING, and the browser had to wait for it to become
    ACTIVATED. This is to avoid including the time to execute the activate event
    handlers in the worker's script. 2) The worker was started for the fetch AND
    DevTools was attached during startup. This is intended to avoid including
    the time for debugging. 3) The request is for New Tab Page. This is because
    it tends to dominate the stats and makes the results largely skewed.

    The type of preparation needed for the browser to find and possibly start an

    This is similar to

    The difference is ServiceWorker.NavPreload.WorkerPreparationType gets logged
    if the navigation preload successfully occurred, at the same time as the
    other ServiceWorker.NavPreload.* metrics so is more safely comparable to

    the future the server might respond with a valid Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    header when presented with an expected Origin request header.

    Logged when 1) CORB processes a http response (so excluding requests from
    allowlisted content script and requests from extension background pages
    where CORB is disabled) and 2) the request was associated with a non-http
    isolated world origin (so not logging anything when the
    CorbAllowlistAlsoAppliesToOorCors and OOR-CORS features are enabled since
    the former feature forces ignoring the isolated world origin when OOR-CORS
    is enabled) and 3) CORB allows the response (based on non-CORB-content-type
    header OR sniffing decided that this is not a CORB type).

    Logs &quot;risky&quot; if the request would be blocked by CORS if made from
    a web page (cross-origin, mode=cors, and no valid ACAO response header).

    Tab Search is a feature that allows users to better search their browsers
    for their desired tabs. It can be opened and closed. This records the amount
    of time between when a Tab Search bubble is opened and when it is closed. It
    does so by recording the difference in time between when the Tab Search's
    WebView is first set visible and when the WebView's destructor is called.

    The Tab Search UI is a bubble anchored to an element within a browser window
    and is closed if the user switches to a tab, presses the escape key or
    performs an action to return focus to the hosting window. The Tab Search UI
    bubble will also close if the hosting browser window is closed or crashes.

    Users may leave the bubble open for long periods of time without directly
    interacting with the UI which could result in a long tail of displayed
    durations.

    Time elapsed between when a task is posted and when it starts to run.

    scenario. Its total count can also be used as a proxy for the number of
    tasks posted to a given category. On the other hand, a fallout of this
    metric is that timing every task means each report is dependent on the many
    things that can cause an individual task to be delayed (e.g. tasks on a
    single bogged down sequence will be reported with high latency even if not
    stalling the scheduler itself). See
    TaskScheduler.HeartbeatLatencyMicroseconds.* for a metric that is

    This metric logs CLD3-detected languages for pages that specify a
