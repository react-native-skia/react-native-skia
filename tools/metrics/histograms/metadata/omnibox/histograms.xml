    When the user focuses or types into the omnibox, the dropdown results can be
    updated multiple times per input (i.e. when focused, per char typed,
    backspace, etc).

    Specifically, the set of events that trigger dropdown updates are:

    - synchronous suggestions

    - asynchronous suggestions. Can trigger multiple times per input. These are
    often generated on different threads.

    - expiring copied matches

    - interruptions e.g. additional user input changes or closing the dropdown

    A sample flow looks like:

    1) User types a character.

    2) 10ms later, update results with synchronous suggestions.

    3) 50ms later, update results with some asynchronous suggestions.

    4) 50ms later, update results with more asynchronous suggestions.

    5) 400ms later, update results by removing copied matches from the previous
    input.

    6) 50 later, update results with the last batch of asynchronous suggestions.

    The 'Provider.*' slices measure the time between the input change and the
    last async update of that provider is done or interrupted. Includes async
    updates that have no user visible change (i.e. that do not produce async
    matches or produce only async matches that get deduped, culled, or are the
    same as the existing match in its position). Only logged for asynchronous
    providers. Emitted exactly once per input per asynchronous provider;

  <summary>
    Records the time taken between a keystroke being typed in the omnibox and
    the text being painted. If there are multiple keystrokes before a paint,
    logs the time since the earliest one.

    This duration is composed of three parts:

    a) the time spent processing the initial input event

    b) the time spent for the repaint task to be scheduled on the message loop

    c) the time spent painting the Omnibox

    d) (on views platforms) the time until the pixels are actually composited

    There's a number of breakdown metrics to help diagnose a regression. First,
    Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency.ToPaint measures the combined time of (a)
    and (b). Omnibox.QueryTime2 is a good proxy for just (a). And there's also
    Omnibox.PaintTime that corresponds to (c). We don't have a direct metric for
    (d), but if neither Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency.ToPaint nor
    Omnibox.PaintTime regressed, then the regression must be in (d).

    Note: The semantics of this metric on views platforms changed in M62, as
    previously time (d) was not included in the metric.

    A refinement of Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency metric. It measures the

    Compositor-provided timestamps are used for this version of the metric, so
    it is expected to be more accurate: the baseline CharTypedToRepaintLatency
    uses now() from when the subsequent has-processed notification arrives back
    on the UI thread, which may overestimate user-visible latency.

  <summary>
    Recorded every time the omnibox is focussed and a recent content from the
    user's clipboard is suggested. The number emitted is the number of times the
    clipboard content has been suggested within the same session including the
    current time. Thus, the third time it is shown, we'll emit a three to this
    histogram, and this histogram will have previously seen emits of one and
    two. If the clipboard content was the same during a previous run of Chrome
    and this clipboard content was suggested during that run, those impressions
    are not counted. Also, if the clipboard content changes during a particular
    run of Chrome to other content, the omnibox is focused and that clipboard
    content is suggested, then content changes back and Chrome starts suggesting
    the older clipboard content again, the counts start again from scratch.
    Chrome only remembers the number of times the clipboard content was shown
    consecutively.

    This value is useful to compare with the number of times a clipboard
    suggestion has been shown when it is clicked. This value can be obtained
    from OmniboxEvent records in which the selected suggestion is from Clipboard
    provider. In those cases, look in the Clipboard provider's ProviderInfo
    field for |times_returned_results_in_session|. Note that at the time of this
    writing that OmniboxEvent logs aren't recorded in incognito whereas
    histograms are. Thus, the total counts will not be comparable, though the
    distributions should be.

    Recorded every time the omnibox is focussed and a recent content from the

    NTP).

    On Android, the total count for this histogram can be usefully compared with
    the count of the user action FocusLocation in order to determine the rate at
    which a clipboard suggestion is shown in the omnibox. To determine the same
    rate on iOS, one needs to compare this histogram's count with the sum of the
    user actions MobileFocusedOmniboxOnNtp, MobileFocusedFakeboxOnNtp, and
    MobileFocusedOmniboxNotOnNtp.

    Furthermore, on either platform, this histogram's count can be usefully
    compared with the count in the clipboard bucket of the
    Omnibox.SuggestionUsed.Provider histogram to determine the clickthrough rate
    on these suggestions.

    When the omnibox is focused and escape is pressed, the 1st of the following
    occurs:

    1) If there is temporary text (i.e. a non default suggestion is selected),
    it is cleared.

    2) If the popup is open and the `kClosePopupWithEscape` feature is enabled,
    the popup is closed.

    3) If the popup is open, which is considered as user input in progress, then
    the popup is closed and user input is cleared.

    4) If user input is in progress, it is cleared. This state (i.e. input in
    progress with the popup closed) typically occurs when input was in progress,
    then the omnibox was blurred, and then it was refocused.

    5) If the `kBlurWithEscape` feature is enabled, it is blurred.

    6) Otherwise, omnibox state is unchanged. This doesn't mean the escape did
    nothing; e.g., it may have stopped a navigation. Some of the cases,
    including case (6), may also select the omnibox's entire text, but this
    isn't recorded.

    This histogram records which of the above occurred.

    It is recorded every time escape is pressed with the omnibox focused. With
    the `kBlurWithEscape` feature disabled, pressing escape e.g. 10 times will
    emit the metric 10 times; but with the feature enabled, it emits at most 4
    times until the omnibox is blurred.

    Fuzzy match conversion produces modified matches from other synchronous

    (this includes the zero case where corrections are found but produce no
    matches). Logs for each fuzzy sub-provider the number of correction matches
    converted to fuzzy provider matches for a single omnibox input. This
    measures how many 'best' matches (among all the sub-provider's matches for a
    specific correction) are converted from this sub-provider, summed for the
    various corrections of a single user input (will not exceed
    `provider_max_matches_` even in unlikely extreme cases). This is useful in

    presence and engagement with fuzzy URL suggestions. It can be interpreted as
    a click through rate for fuzzy match presentation as a whole: given that any

    how often was the selected match a fuzzy URL suggestion?

    This tracks how unstable omnibox matches are.

    Typically, each input change is followed by a single synchronous update, and
    then approximately 3 asynchronous updates. There may be more or less
    asynchronous updates depending on which providers are enabled for the
    particular platform/user, the input (e.g. some providers don't run for
    0-length inputs), and how quickly the input changes occur (e.g. if the
    inputs update rapidly, slower async providers won't have time to provide
    updates before they're aborted by newer inputs).

    For each autocomplete update, this histogram logs whether any match position
    changes. If 1 or more matches changed, logs true once; otherwise false once.

    When the number of matches changes, matches that are removed are considered
    a 'change', while matches that are appended are less disruptive to the user
    and not considered a 'change'. This is because this metric is primarily
    interested in how many times the user could be looking at a match with the
    intention of selecting it, and then it surprisingly goes away.

    Note that merely adding a new provider will increase these counts. That's
    intentional. Swapping matches out annoys users, and to avoid this, we should
    do some things like: caching, update coalescing, update deferral until next
    keystroke, provider timeouts, etc.

    This metric is designed to be normalized by the True count of
    Omnibox.Start.WantAsyncMatches, which will yield the number of match changes
    per keystroke or other user gesture.

    There're the related Omnibox.MatchStability2.InAnyPosition.* slices for

    Match changes occur when any match position changes; i.e. is set to a new

    We primarily care about the default match, which is logged at index 0. All

    Counts the type (concept ID) of omnibox pedals shown when the user used the
    omnibox to go somewhere.

    Pedals are a button attached to a search suggestion that either navigate to
    a chrome:// URL or trigger a Chrome action (for example, opening the page
    translation dialog or opening a new window in Incognito mode).

    Note that, while it is uncommon, it is possible for multiple pedals to be

    Measures the number of sessions for which each type of rich autocompletion
    triggered; does not measure the number of times each type of rich
    autocompletion triggered.

    As the user types into the omnibox, the omnibox suggestions are updated.
    Some of those suggestions may have rich autocompletion. No suggestion may
    have multiple types of rich autocompletion. A type of rich autocompletion is
    considered triggered only if the default suggestion has rich autocompletion.
    If a non-default suggestion has rich autocompletion, does not suffice. If
    any input during the session triggered a rich autocompletion type, that type
    is considered triggered for the entire session.

    Recorded multiple times per omnibox session (i.e. per user selecting a
    suggestion). Recorded once for each type of rich autocompletion that
    triggered during the session (i.e. while the user was typing their input).
    If a rich autocompletion type triggered multiple times during the session
    (very common), it will be logged exactly once. Hence, it's impossible for
    any single bucket's count to be larger than the count of omnibox sessions or
    Omnibox.RichAutocompletion.Triggered.Any. If multiple rich autocompletion

    selected, and records &quot;Not Selected&quot; if the offered action chip
    was not selected.

    Therefore the &quot;Selected&quot; bucket proportion is the CTR of the
    action chip. Higher is better. The count of this bucket matches the sum of
    Omnibox.SuggestionUsed.ResumeJourney.

    The total count of both buckets is how many times we've offered the chip
    total, and matches the sum of Omnibox.ResumeJourneyShown.

    Measures the number of sessions for which each type of rich autocompletion
    was used.

    As the user types into the omnibox, the omnibox suggestions are updated.
    Some of those suggestions may have rich autocompletion. No suggestion may
    have multiple types of rich autocompletion. A type of rich autocompletion is
    considered triggered only if the default suggestion has rich autocompletion.
    If a non-default suggestion has rich autocompletion, does not suffice. If
    any input during the session triggered a rich autocompletion type, that type
    is considered triggered for the entire session.

    Recorded exactly once per omnibox session (i.e. per user selecting a

  <summary>
    Measures whether the suggestion that was selected by the user offered a tab
    match and specifically that the user chose the tab match over normal
    navigation. A tab match occurs when the URL specified by the suggestion
    matches the URL navigated to by another tab in the browser, within the
    margin of our URL stripping scheme. By selecting the tab match, the browser
    simply switches focus to the matching tab.

    This metric typically only makes sense with respect to
    Omnibox.SuggestionUsed.OfferedTabMatch. Only recent versions of the browser
    send the metric. Therefore, other metrics may include datapoints not covered
    by this metric (unless one narrows the data by version.)

    This metric should be stricly less than
    Omnibox.SuggestionUsed.OfferedTabMatch, and is typically used to discover
    the percentage of offered tab matches that the user accepts.

    In M-74 and earlier, this was only recorded if the user had no incognito
    windows open. In M-75 and later, it records all omnibox interactions
    regardless, in order to be consistent with how user actions and histograms
    are handled.

    This histogram reports the amount of time it takes to match one set of
    suggestions against all open tabs. This metric is collected once for every
    time a new set of suggestions is received. This includes the Omnibox Focus
    event (when zero-prefix suggestions are offered) and every subsequent key
    stroke, including deletion, backspace etc.

    Each keystroke produces multiple events offering autocomplete matches: a)
    one synchronous, when Start() is called. b) any number of intermediate
    events, depending on whether Providers request the update. c) one at the
    end, when the process completes.

    Since these are produced about 3 times per keystroke, the total time
    consumed per Omnibox interaction is - optimistically -
    3*Omnibox.TypedLength*TabMatchTime. this excludes all the time spent
    formulating the query, such as correcting the input. This metric does not
    express the cumulative time spent matching the tabs (because we do not have
    a metric that counts the number of suggestions the user actually fetched -
    eg. we do not count the number of suggestions received when user pressed the
    backspace key).

    This histogram only records metrics on machines with high-resolution clocks.

    Whether the user has settings configured so that the current page URL can be
    sent to the suggest server to request contextual suggestions. For example,
    this is only supported for users who have Google as their default search
    engine (unmodified version of Google), have search suggest enabled, are
    signed-in and syncing without a custom passphrase, and don't have an
    incognito window open. There are other criteria too. Recorded on focus in
    the omnibox if there is default search provider and we've constructed a
    suggest URL.

    Some additional guidelines: if an incognito window is open, all focus events
    will go into the &quot;generally ineligible&quot; bucket. Likewise, if the
    current page is a search results page, we don't allow contextual suggestions
    either so focus events on those pages go in the &quot;generally
    ineligible&quot; bucket. The difference between &quot;eligible&quot; and
    &quot;generally eligible but not this time&quot; depends only the properties
    of the current URL.

    Recorded regardless of whether contextual or non-contextual zero suggest is
    currently enabled on the user's platform. However, if zero suggest (in all
    forms) is entirely disabled, the user will be perpetually ineligible.

    This histogram captures all scenarios that are generally ineligible for zero
    suggest suggestions (including incognito mode), and reports eligibility for
    suggestions even if kOmniboxPopupShortcutIconsInZeroState is enabled
    (meaning: suggestions are not shown, but current URL is eligible).
