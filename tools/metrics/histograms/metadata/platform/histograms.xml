    Detachable base firmware updates can be configured to only occur on boot. In
    this mode, any update will be considered &quot;pending&quot; until the
    system is rebooted, at which point the update may take place. Every time a
    detachable base is connected to the system, a metric representing the
    pending update status is recorded. Its possible values are as follows: (0)
    communication error; (1) no update available; (2) critical update available;
    or (3) non-critical update available. The definition of &quot;critical&quot;
    is up to the software performing updates, and would typically be used in the
    case of a security issue, or broken functionality in a previous firmware
    version.
