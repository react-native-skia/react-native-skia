    The time it took from when FrameSinkVideoCapturerImpl sent a request for an

    Note: The histogram logging was adjusted in M102 to align with how
    `Viz.FrameSinkVideoCapturer.[RGBA/I420].CaptureDuration` histograms behave.
    After the change, this histogram also started including the time taken to
    set the color space on a video frame.
