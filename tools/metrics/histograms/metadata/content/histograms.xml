    Number of times a given permission was requested by a website and the user
    has the permission set to prompt (i.e. not blocked or allowed).

    Note this is probably not the metric you want - it does not correspond to
    the total number of times websites request a permission. Also, because
    specific permissions have code that can automatically block or grant
    permissions based on things like incognito, installed extensions etc., this
    does also not correspond to the number of times users are prompted to allow
    permissions.

    For a better metric to track how often users are prompted, either use
    ContentSettings.PermissionsActions*, or Permissions.Prompt.*.

    See https://crbug.com/638076 for more details.

    Tracks each instance of user engagement with {FeedType}, by scrolling or

    interaction, and we report ENGAGED and ENGAGED_SIMPLE once per user visit. A
    user visit is when the user scrolls or interacts with the NTP more than 5
    minutes after the previous visit. The SCROLLED engagement type represents a

    The INTERACTED engagement type represents one instance of using the menu or
    opening a feed article into its own tab. SCROLLED and INTERACTED are
    reported for every occurrence, thus we could end up with more scrolled and

    Android: Reports the number of cards in the {FeedType}. Reported when the
    last card of the {FeedType} is shown. Note that this is reported even if the
    Feed is attempting to load additional content (LoadMore), as long as the
    last card is 2/3rds shown before additional content loads. In this case,
    this histogram can be reported multiple times without leaving the Feed
    surface.
