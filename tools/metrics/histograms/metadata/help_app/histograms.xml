<histogram name="Discover.Search.SearchStatus"
    enum="LocalSearchServiceResponseStatus" expires_after="2022-01-08">
  <owner>callistus@google.com</owner>
  <owner>showoff-eng@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the search status when searching with the Local Search Service in
    the Discover (internally &quot;Showoff&quot;) app. This is logged once per
    user search and will count the number of searches while the index is still
    empty, successful searches, etc.

<histogram name="Discover.SearchHandler.SearchResultStatus"
    enum="HelpAppSearchHandlerSearchResultStatus" expires_after="2023-03-19">
  <owner>zufeng@google.com</owner>
  <owner>showoff-eng@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The end result of a search using the help app search handler. Logged once
    per time a search finishes. Not logged if the search is canceled by a new
    search starting. Use this to calculate the proportion of searches where the
    search handler is ready vs not ready. &quot;Ready&quot; means the first
    update finished and the search handler is ready to handle searches.
