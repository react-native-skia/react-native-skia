# Caspian

[TOC]

## What is it?

Caspian is the name for the WebAssembly portion of the SuperSize Tiger Viewer.
It also contains a Linux command-line test binary.

## Building the WASM Module

### 1. Install Emscripten

This step needs to be only once.

1. `git clone` emscripten:
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
2. Install the known working version:
   ```sh
   cd $EMSDK; ./emsdk install 3.1.9 && ./emsdk activate 3.1.9
   ```
3. Activate it via environment variables:
   ```sh
   cd $EMSDK; source emsdk_env.sh
   ```

### 2. Apply Local Patches

Caspian needs some minor edits that we don't want to commit:

```sh
git apply -3 tools/binary_size/libsupersize/viewer/caspian/wasmbuild.patch
```

To re-create .patch file:
```sh
git add ...files to include in patch...
git diff --staged > tools/binary_size/libsupersize/viewer/caspian/wasmbuild.patch
# Double check that only expected files are included in the patch:
grep +++ tools/binary_size/libsupersize/viewer/caspian/wasmbuild.patch
```

### 3. Build

```sh
# Omit is_official_build=true if developing locally.
gn gen out/caspian --args='is_official_build=true treat_warnings_as_errors=false fatal_linker_warnings=false chrome_pgo_phase=0'
# Build and copy into static/ directory:
( cd out/caspian; autoninja caspian_web && cp wasm/caspian_web.* ../../tools/binary_size/libsupersize/viewer/static/ )
```

## Building the Linux Test App & Unit Tests

There is a test and a binary that you can run to help with development (and
allows debugging outside of the browser).

```sh
OUT=$out/linux_debug
autoninja -C $OUT caspian_cli caspian_unittests
$OUT/caspian_cli --help
$OUT/caspian_unittests
# To debug a crash:
lldb $OUT/caspian_cli validatediff supersize_diff.sizediff
```

## Debugging WASM

Based on this article: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/

The one-time setup steps are:

 * On the same machine as your source code:
   * Install Chrome Canary (`sudo apt-get install google-chrome-unstable`)
   * Open Chrome Canary
 * Install the Chrome extension: https://goo.gle/wasm-debugging-extension
 * Enable DWARF debugging in DevTools' experiments panel
   * Gears button in top right, then "experiments" on left nav, then filter for "dwarf".

The every-time steps are:

 * Start server: `tools/binary_size/libsupersize/viewer/upload_html_viewer.py --local`
 * Open `viewer.html` and load a file.
 * Open DevTools to the "Sources" panel.
 * Look for `tree-worker-wasm.js  > file://`
 * Find the `.cc` files within it and set breakpoints.

## Updating Emscripten Version

1. Run:
   ```
   cd $PATH_TO_EMSDK
   git pull origin main --tags
   ```
2.  Update this README's Emscripten version above, then follow its steps.

## Code Overview

Caspian is a port of the Python implementation, and tries as much as possible to
follow the same patterns and names as the Python. Keeping them as similar as
possible makes it easier to keep them in sync.

### Code Style

Follow Chrome's C++ [styleguide] where possible. One notable exception is that
Caspian does not use `//base` due to the current lack of WASM support in it.
