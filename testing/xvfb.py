  Works around a bug in GLib where it performs operations which aren't

  utility processes to get stuck, and this harness to hang waiting for those
  processes, which will never terminate. This doesn't happen on users'
  machines, because they have an active desktop session and the
  DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable set, but it can happen on
  headless environments. This is fixed by glib commit [1], but this workaround
  will be necessary until the fix rolls into Chromium's CI.
