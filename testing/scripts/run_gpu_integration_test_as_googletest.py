"""Runs an isolate bundled Telemetry GPU integration test.

If optional argument --isolated-script-test-output=[FILENAME] is passed
to the script, json is written to that file in the format detailed in
//docs/testing/json-test-results-format.md.

If optional argument --isolated-script-test-filter=[TEST_NAMES] is passed to
the script, it should be a  double-colon-separated ("::") list of test names,
to run just that subset of tests.

This script is intended to be the base command invoked by the isolate,
followed by a subsequent Python script. It could be generalized to
invoke an arbitrary executable.
