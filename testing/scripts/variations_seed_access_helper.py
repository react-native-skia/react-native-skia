  There are 2 types of seeds used by this smoke test:
  1. A provided seed under test, and when the test is running with this seed,
     it's running as a TRY job and is triggered by the finch_smoke_test recipe
     to test the Finch GCL config changes. The interface between the recipe and
     this test is a json file named variations_seed located at the root of
     the checkout.
  2. A hard-coded seed, and when the test is running with this seed, it's
     running on CI continuously to prevent regressions to this test itself.

  The function tries to use provided seed first. If the provided seed doesn't
  exist, the function will fallback to a hard-coded seed as input arg.

  Args:
    seed_json_path (str): Path to provided hard-coded seed.

  Returns:
