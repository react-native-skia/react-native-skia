# This test relies on window activation, which currently is not possible
# on Wayland without using unstandardized protocol extensions. Once
# support for the xdg-activation extension has been implemented (see
# https://crbug.com/1360854), this test should pass. As soon as the compositor
# that is used on the test bot supports this extension, the test can be enabled.
