# Fuzz testing in Chromium

[go/chrome-fuzzing](https://goto.google.com/chrome-fuzzing)

[Fuzzing] is a testing technique that feeds auto-generated inputs to a piece
of target code in an attempt to crash the code. It's one of the most effective
methods we have for finding security and stability issues (see
[go/fuzzing-success](http://go/fuzzing-success)). You can learn more about the
benefits of fuzzing at [go/why-fuzz](http://go/why-fuzz).

This documentation covers the in-process guided fuzzing approach employed by
different fuzzing engines, such as [libFuzzer] or [AFL]. To learn more about
out-of-process fuzzers, please refer to the [Blackbox fuzzing] page in the
ClusterFuzz documentation.

[TOC]

## Getting Started

In Chromium, you can easily create and submit fuzz targets. The targets are
automatically discovered by buildbots, built with different fuzzing engines,
then uploaded to the distributed [ClusterFuzz] fuzzing system to run at scale.

Create your first fuzz target and submit it by stepping through our [Getting
Started Guide].

## Advanced Topics

* [Improving fuzz target efficiency].
* [Creating a fuzz target that expects a protobuf] instead of a byte stream as
  input.

  *** note
  **Note:** You can also fuzz code that needs multiple mutated
  inputs, or to generate inputs defined by a grammar.

* [Reproducing bugs] found by libFuzzer/AFL and reported by ClusterFuzz.
* [Fuzzing mojo interfaces] using automatically generated libprotobuf-mutator fuzzers.
