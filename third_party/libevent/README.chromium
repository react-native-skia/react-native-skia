Local Modifications:
Rather than use libevent's own build system, we just build a Chrome
static library using GYP.

1) Run configure and "make event-config.h" on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris,
   and Mac and copy config.h and event-config.h to linux/, freebsd/,
   solaris/, and mac/ respectively.
2) Add libevent.gyp.
3) chromium.patch is applied to make the following changes:
   - Allow libevent to be used without being installed by changing <...>
     #includes to "...".
   - Fix a race condition in event_del.
   - Optimistically assume CLOCK_MONOTONIC is available and fallback if it
     fails, rather than explicitly testing for it.
   - Remove an unneeded variable that causes a -Werror build failure.
   - Add an #ifndef to fix a preprocessor redefined -Werror build failure.
   - Revert the patch from http://sourceforge.net/p/levent/bugs/223/ that
     introduces use-after-free memory corruption when an event callback frees
     the struct event memory.
   - Remove deprecated global variables, event_sigcb and event_gotsig
     (essentially unused) that trigger tsan errors. (crbug/605894)
4) The directories WIN32-Code and WIN32-Prj are not included.
5) The configs for android were copied from Linux's which were very close to
   android one with the exception of HAVE_FD_MASK and HAVE_STRLCPY.
6) Remove an unnecessary workaround for OS X 10.4 from kqueue.c. It was causing
   problems on macOS Sierra.
7) Change buffer.c to not redefine _GNU_SOURCE.
8) Change _event_strlcpy in strlcpy.c to not use K&R syntax.
9) Change a bitfield in evhttp.h from int to unsigned int.
